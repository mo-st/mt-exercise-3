&#91; Finn and Jake are sitting atop a cliff made from a decrepit skyscraper overlooking a body of water &#93; Finn : Hey , Jake , do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who ’ s like your opposite ?
Jake : I don ’ t know .
I ’ m the &quot; first come first serve &quot; kinda guy .
Get in line , ladies !
This Rainicorn thing can ’ t last forever !
&#91; chuckles &#93; &#91; Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass , unnoticed by Finn and Jake &#93; I didn ’ t mean that .
Don ’ t spread that around .
Finn : So it ’ s not good to weigh someone ’ s qualities against your own ?
Jake : Well , no .
I mean , if you feel something , you feel something !
&#91; Jake ’ s head turns into a graph and his hand an upward moving arrow &#93; It ’ s not about personality matrixals and charts , it ’ s all about the bu-bumps in your heart !
&#91; His head is a heart shape that beats every time he say “ bumps ” or “ pumps ” .
He gets extremely close to Finn and his eyes are bugging out &#93; You can ’ t stop the pumps and bumps !
Pumps and bumps !
Pumps and bumps !
&#91; Finn chuckles , as does Magic Man &#93; Finn : Alright , well , what about BMO and Ice King ?
Jake : What about them ?
&#91; Looks confused &#93; Finn : Would they make a good couple ?
Jake : Whoa !
Wait !
Did BMO say something to you ?
Finn : No no !
Jake : Oh , I see .
You ’ re being weird .
&#91; Magic man reaches down into his hole and pulls out a bag &#93; Finn : It ’ s not that weird !
Come on !
Magic Man &#91; quietly &#93; : Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law .
Jake : BMO and Ice King ?
&#91; Magic man puts the bag on the outside of Finn ’ s pants &#93; Finn : Yeah !
Magic Man &#91; quietly &#93; : I ’ m not coming back .
&#91; Retreats into his hole &#93; Jake : You ’ re creepin ’ me out .
&#91; Gets up &#93; Finn : I ’ m just thinkin ’ out loud .
&#91; Jake starts walking away and Finn bends forward so he can see Jake between his legs &#93; What , can ’ t think out loud ?
&#91; Finn is walking back home with Jake &#93; Jake : Oh , is that what you ’ re doing ?
Finn : Yeah man !
Pffft , jeez don ’ t be judgy .
Jake : I ’ m not !
Finn : Yeah , you are !
Jake : How could you know that ?
Finn : I can hear it in your tone .
Jake : You can ?
&#91; in a mocking tone &#93; Finn : Yeah , wise-guy .
Jake : &#91; Pointing to the bag &#93; Hey , what ’ s that in your pants ?
Finn : &#91; Looking at the back of his pants &#93; What ? !
Not again !
&#91; Finn sees the bag on the other side &#93; Oh .
I don ’ t know .
&#91; Finn grabs the bag &#93; Whoa , look .
Jake : Crazy .
&#91; Finn opens the bag and reaches in &#93; Careful , dude .
Finn : What the-- ?
&#91; Finn pulls out his hand with Princess Bubblegum , Lumpy Space Princess , BMO , Jake , and himself &#93; Jake : What the heck ? !
Are they alive ? !
&#91; They are now moving around aimlessly &#93; Finn : Hey , are you guys alive ?
&#91; BMO starts to fall off , but Jake catches him &#93; I don ’ t know , man , I think they ’ re some kind of magic toy .
Jake : Maybe it ’ s black magic .
Maybe we shouldn ’ t mess with them .
Finn : No , man , look !
That ’ s you !
&#91; Jake is playing the viola with Lumpy Space Princess on his back and Finn and BMO are dancing to the music &#93; You ’ re totally shedding on the viola .
Jake : Yeah , that ’ s good .
How many more thingies are in there ?
Finn : &#91; Looks in the bag &#93; Dude .
Like a lot .
Come on !
Let ’ s check this out at the house .
&#91; They run towards the house &#93; Jake : I ’ ll make a special spagot &#91; spaghetti &#93; with a new sauce .
&#91; Finn is at the table while Jake is cooking the spaghetti .
He dumps out some of the little people onto the table &#93; Finn : Sheesh .
So many .
PB , you hang out with Lady .
&#91; Picks up Princess Bubblegum and moves her towards Lady &#93; C-listers , go back in the bag .
&#91; Pushes Xergiok , Donny , Tiffany , Lemongrab , one of the Gumdrop lasses , and &apos;Turtle Princess &#93; Jake : &#91; stirring the noodles &#93; Who ’ s in the C-list ?
&#91; Adds something , possibly wine , from a bottle , then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate &#93; Finn : Tiffany , Donny .
&#91; To himself &#93; Well , he ’ s okay .
&#91; Out loud &#93; Xergiok ... a bunch o &apos; these guys !
Jake : That ’ s not very nice .
&#91; Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table &#93; Finn : Don ’ t worry , man .
They ’ ll get involved eventually .
Jake : Involved with what ?
&#91; Sits down and gives Finn his food &#93; Finn : I don ’ t know .
Involved .
Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum !
Jake : &#91; Stretches to get forks .
Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation .
It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions &#93; What are they talkin ’ about ?
Finn : It ’ s hard to say , but I think it ’ s got something to do with Lady being preggos &#91; pregnant &#93; .
Jake : Whoa !
What kinda narrative are you trying to create here ? !
Finn : That ’ s your narrative , buddy .
Jake : Alright , well , what else ya got goin ’ on ?
Finn : Hmm .
Not much really .
I got Ice King over here .
&#91; Points to Ice King &#93; Jake : Ice King ?
He ’ s not C-list ?
Finn : &#91; Looking through the bag to find Ice King &apos;s drum kit &#93; Yeah , well , I saw his drum kit in here .
Here we go .
&#91; Puts it in front of Ice King &#93; Okay , jam out , little Ice King .
&#91; Ice King starts playing &#93; Jake : &#91; Little Jake sees the Ice King playing and runs over to him to join in &#93; No .
Don ’ t play with that hack .
Aww , man .
Hmm .
&#91; Jake looks surprised &#93; They ’ ve got good chemistry .
Who ’ d have guessed ?
Finn : Chemistry ... &#91; Finn looks as though he just had a good idea .
He looks at several groups of toy people .
Ice King and Jake playing together .
Marceline and Hunson Abadeer in the background with Finn stealing Lemongrab ’ s Lemon Camel in the foreground .
Mr. Cupcake exercising .
Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess playing cards &#93; Jake : Hey , Finn , eat the food before it gets cold .
&#91; Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess &#93; I made a new sauce !
Umm , earth to Finn , are you okay ?
Finn : Yeees .
&#91; Later on , Finn is now awake , but in bed with Jake fast asleep .
Finn looks over at Jake to make sure he ’ s asleep .
Confident that he ’ s asleep , he grabs the bag from under his pillow and retreats into his sleeping bag .
He takes the lens off a flashlight and puts it in front of him .
Then he takes Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess out .
Mr. Cupcake starts flexing and Lumpy Space Princess is impressed .
Finn chuckles .
Lumpy Space Princess looks enamored and begins working her lumps .
Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess start kissing &#93; Finn : Whoooooa .
&#91; Finn looks curious and takes away Lumpy Space Princess .
Mr. Cupcake looks surprised .
Finn looks and the bag and then mixes it .
Finn grabs Lady and then checks to make sure Jake is still asleep .
He then puts Lady next to Mr. Cupcake .
Mr. Cupcake starts flexing , but Lady ignores him and grazes a piece of Finn ’ s sleeping bag .
When he sees nothing is happening , he pushes Lady into Mr. Cupcakes arms .
Mr. Cupcake wiggles his eyebrows and Lady laughs . &#93;
&#91; Finn then grabs Jake and contemplates what he ’ s about to do .
He looks a bit concerned .
Lady and Mr. Cupcake are kissing and Finn puts Jake right in front of them .
Jake doesn ’ t notice , but Finn moves his head around to see them .
Then Jake starts yelling “ wah ” .
Mr. Cupcake drops Lady and she acts with indignation towards Jake .
Jake argues back and then Mr. Cupcake starts yelling at Jake .
Jake pushes him and Lady pleads that they not fight .
Finn looks towards the bag and then looks back with realization .
He empties out the bag .
The scene ends . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Jake wakes up and heads down stairs .
Finn is sitting at the dinner table with a multitude of Jay T. Doggzone books arranged into a little town &#93; You ’ re up early .
Finn : I didn ’ t sleep .
&#91; Very blunt and tired &#93; Jake : &#91; Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug &#93; You stay up all night readin ’ trash books ?
&#91; Finn makes a weak “ meh ” sound . &#93;
I told you , man .
Those datin ’ books .
&#91; Sips drink &#93; That stuff is mess you up .
&#91; Drinks again &#93; Finn : I ’ m not reading .
I ’ m playing with the little wees .
Jake : Oh , let me see little me .
&#91; Stretches his head to find little Jake is sitting by himself next to an open book &#93; Me look so lonely .
Hey , Finn , pass me little Lady .
Finn : Uh , you guys broke up .
Jake : &#91; Confused &#93; Wha ?
Finn : She ’ s with someone else now .
Jake : &#91; Angry &#93; Who ? !
Finn : He ’ s a cool guy , don ’ t worry about it .
Jake : &#91; Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source .
He finds little Finn in Lady ’ s lap kissing under a book teepee &#93; Ahhhhhh !
&#91; Slams his fists on the table &#93; What the ball , man ? !
Finn : &#91; Laughs and shrugs ; he doesn ’ t sound as worn out as before &#93; What ?
Jake : What ?
What do ya think “ what ” ? !
Finn : Come on , they ’ re not real , they ’ re like toys .
These guys here , they ’ re goin ’ out .
&#91; Points the Marceline and Peppermint Butler in a tea cup .
Marceline licks the red off of Peppermint Butler ’ s side . &#93;
Pretty serious .
And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl .
They ’ re still testing the waters .
&#91; Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl are dancing and are joined by Abracadaniel &#93; But I think things are gonna work out .
Check out Xergiok and Turtle P. &#91; Turtle Princess is seen lightly spanking Xergiok .
Finn laughs . &#93;
Weird .
But cool .
Right , Jake ?
Jake : &#91; slowly backs towards the exit &#93; I don ’ t like where you ’ re going with this .
It ain ’ t wholesome .
I ’ m gonna go to Lady ’ s for a few days .
To clear my head .
&#91; Leaves &#93; Finn : Okay .
Whatever whatevs .
&#91; Goes over to little Finn and Lady and chuckles &#93; Weird .
&#91; Grabs little Finn and Flame Princess &#93; Huh ?
&#91; Finn puts both of them near each other , but nothing happens .
Finn breaks off part of a cookie and puts in on little Finn ’ s head .
He grabs it and Flame Princess yawns .
Finn uses a pencil to move little Finn ’ s legs to walk towards Flame Princess .
Flame Princess is pleasantly surprised to see little Finn and giggles .
Little Finn breaks part of the cookie crumb off and gives it to Flame Princess .
They then start to eat each end of what ’ s left .
Lady comes out of her teepee to see little Finn and Flame Princess and starts crying hysterically and runs back to the book house &#93; &#91; Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn .
At first they awkwardly stand around , but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum ’ s hand onto little Finn ’ s shoulder .
She begins massaging his shoulders and he likes it .
Real Finn looks around nervously to make sure no one can see what he ’ s doing .
Then they kiss and Flame Princess is outraged .
She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back .
Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation , but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum .
Princess Bubblegum ’ s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady ’ s teepee .
Using Lady as a kind of hose , the water being her tears , Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess .
They begin fighting and real Finn is astonished and begins blushing . &#93;
&#91; A card that reads &quot; 16 WEEKS LATER &quot; comes up . &#93;
Jake : I ’ m back !
I got over all that messed up stuff you did .
&#91; The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful &#93; Yeesh .
You okay , man ?
Finn : I don ’ t know .
&#91; Little Finn is standing on top of a book staring into the distance &#93; Jake : What ’ s little Finn doing ?
Finn : He ’ s ... thinking .
Jake : &#91; Looks concerned &#93; He looks sad .
What ’ s he thinking about ?
Finn : I don ’ t know .
Probably lots of stuff .
Jake : Where ’ s little Rainicorn ?
Finn : Probably still crying .
Jake : Wha ?
Finn : She ’ s not handling the break-up very well .
Jake : &#91; sees Lady still crying in her teepee &#93; Aww .
Finn : PB &apos;s good , though .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned .
She looks very angry . &#93;
After little Finn dumped her , she started working out .
Looks like she ’ s really into it .
Jake : This is messed up , dude .
You ’ ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff .
Finn : &#91; Looks perturbed &#93; I know !
Jake : &#91; Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler &#93; The destruction !
&#91; Xergiok looks like he ’ s in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him &#93; The depravity !
&#91; Choose Goose , Abracadaniel , and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together &#93; The wrongness of it all !
I ’ m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it .
&#91; Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms . &#93;
Finn : No , man !
I gotta fix this mess !
Look at me , man !
I ’ m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole !
I gotta help him !
Jake : You can ’ t !
Just let them do their own biz , man !
Finn : I junked them up too hard though !
I gotta step in !
Jake : How would ya do that ?
Finn : &#91; Lets go of his arms and Jake steps back &#93; I ’ m gonna talk to him .
Jake : But he can ’ t hear you .
Finn : Yeah , why is that ?
Jake : Hmm .
Maybe we ’ re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror .
So we can see him , but he can ’ t see us .
Finn : &#91; Gets really close to little Finn &#93; Lemme try this .
Finn !
Can you hear me ?
&#91; Sticks his tongue out while talking and pokes little Finn a few times &#93; We ’ re connected !
FINN !
&#91; Little Finn is shown standing as the same cliff shown in the beginning of the episode and talks as though he ’ s depressed &#93; Jake : Try shakin ’ him .
Finn : Why ?
Jake : Maybe we ’ re vibrating on different intervals .
Try shakin ’ him at different speeds and see if he responds .
Finn : &#91; Grabs him and starts shaking &#93; Okay .
Fiiiiiiinn !
Fiiiiiiiiiinn !
Jake : Now go faster !
Finn : FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN !
&#91; In the Little People &apos;s world , some clouds begin to form a crude Finn head . &#93;
Jake : Faster !
Finn : &#91; The cloud Finn says this in the Little People &apos;s world &#93; FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN !
&#91; The clouds dissipate and little Finn looks surprised &#93; Jake : Go slower , he saw you !
Finn : Okay .
&#91; In the Little People ’ s world &#93; Fiiiinn .
Can you hear me ?
Little Finn : Wah wah wah .
Jake : Whoa !
Neat !
Finn : I made you do those crummy things .
I ’ m why yous guys is fighting .
I ’ m the big you .
I came to apologize .
I will never interfere with your lives again .
&#91; Little Finn asks a question &#93; Don ’ t worry I will take care of it .
&#91; The clouds dissipate and then reassemble &#93; Sorry , my arm got tired .
&#91; Little Finn is confused by this . &#93;
Never mind .
It ’ ll be fine .
Goodbye , little Finn !
I ’ m not coming back !
Jake : Now what ?
Finn : &#91; shaking Lady , Princess Bubblegum , and Flame Princess at the same time and they all see the cloud &#93; Hey , ladies !
This is big Finn !
I caused all the problems !
It wasn ’ t anyone ’ s fault !
Don ’ t be mad at each other !
Have a … dance party !
Okay , goodbye !
I ’ m not coming back !
&#91; Finn pulls a stereo out of the bag and starts the music .
The three of them begin dancing and with the others . &#93;
Jake : Is that gonna do it ?
&#91; The little people join the party and start dancing &#93; Get the C-listers out .
&#91; They begin dancing as well &#93; Good party .
Oh , flip !
&#91; BMO and the Ice King are dancing &#93; Look who ’ s hittin ’ it off with the Ice King !
&#91; Chuckles &#93; &#91; Princess Bubblegum is in her lab working on a circuit board when a cloaked bird drops a letter on her table and flies away . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : What the ... &#91; she breaks the seal on the letter and reads it aloud &#93; &quot; mmmmn Princess Bubblegum , we are starving , immediately send us all of your candy .
How dare you , ours , Lemon Grabs . &quot;
&#91; stops reading &#93; Bull gunk !
I left them a lifetime supply of candy !
&#91; She swivels her chair to the window and looks out at Jake and Cinnamon Bun having a picnic , with Finn watching in the bushes . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Hey Finn !
Hey Jake !
Can you come up here ?
I have a job for you !
Finn : Okay !
Jake : &#91; getting up &#93; Sorry CB , we &apos;ll finish this up later .
&#91; Scene changes to inside Princess Bubblegum &apos;s lab .
Princess Bubblegum is loading small , colorful spheres into a case . &#93;
Finn : &#91; entering room &#93; Hey , Preebs .
Princess Bubblegum : Hey , guys .
I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab .
They &apos;ve gone through all the food that I &apos;ve sent them .
&#91; gestures to case &#93; This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food .
&#91; closes case &#93; So , I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle .
&#91; hands case to Jake &#93; Finn : For sure .
We &apos;ll do it .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; saluting &#93; Good luck , gentlemen !
&#91; Finn jumps on Jake who jumps out the window and stretches his ears into wings . &#93;
Cinnamon Bun : &#91; waving &#93; Bye , girlfriend !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; Finn and Jake make their way to Castle Lemongrab and open the gate . &#93;
Jake : Hey , Lemongrabs !
You home ?
Finn : Holy-- !
&#91; They see various Lemon creatures , who start advancing toward them and touching them . &#93;
Finn : &#91; worried &#93; Jake ?
Jake , Jake , Jake , Jake !
Jake : &#91; smacking a Lemon spider off his arm &#93; Kiss it !
&#91; Finn and Jake start backing away from the creatures through the courtyard . &#93;
Finn : Aah !
Sorry , dudes--got no food !
No ... food !
&#91; Lemon goat bites Finn &apos;s hand &#93; Hey !
Jake : Hey !
Weirdos !
&#91; stretches his hand into a slice of cake &#93; Get the birthday cake !
&#91; Jake pretends to throw it , and the Lemon people run over to where they think it landed .
Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up and go through another gate .
On the opposite wall is a giant Lemon creature &apos;s face . &#93;
Lemonjon : Are you lemon ?
Finn and Jake : Whoa !
Jake : What the thing is up with this guy ?
Lemonjon : Does your head come to a nub ?
Jake : What ?
Lemonjon : You are un-lemon .
Finn : Yeah .
Cool , man .
Hey , do you know where-- ?
Lemonjon : I am Lemonjon .
I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie !
Finn : Wait , what ?
Lemonjon : They &apos;re quite hungry .
Finn : Yeah .
What the heck &apos;s going on here ?
Lemonjon : There is no food , only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts !
Finn : Whatever , Lemonjon .
We &apos;ve gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds .
Jake : Where should we go ?
Lemonjon : Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they &apos;re in the dungeon .
They &apos;ve been there for three weeks .
Three weeks , dungeon .
Jake : I wonder who put them in there .
Finn : I don &apos;t know , but we gotta bust them out !
Which way to the dungeon , Lemonjon ?
&#91; Lemonjon picks up a rock with his lips and throws it at the wall , making a hole . &#93;
Jake : Oh , cool !
Finn : &#91; running to hole &#93; Thanks , man !
Jake : &#91; going through hole &#93; Yeah , thanks , man !
&#91; Finn and Jake make their way down a poorly lit corridor .
Something skitters across the screen behind them . &#93;
Jake : &#91; turns around &#93; Hmmm .
&#91; A brick in the ceiling falls down and shatters .
Jake clears his throat and he and Finn walk along the wall past it .
Finn opens a door and looks inside .
He sees a gigantic heart that isn &apos;t pumping and a large pipe dumping yellow liquid through a grate .
Finn closes the door . &#93;
Jake : Hmmm .
&#91; They continue down some stairs and come to a door . &#93;
Finn : &#91; opening door &#93; Yo , Lemon-wipes !
&#91; Past the door are more gigantic organs , swelling and wriggling . &#93;
Jake : Yech .
&#91; They close the door and walk down a different hallway . &#93;
Jake : Um , maybe we should hands ... for safety .
Finn : &#91; taking Jake &apos;s hand &#93; Yeah , sure !
Jake : So , where &apos;d you want to look ne-- &#91; looks at what he &apos;s holding , which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand . &#93;
Eeeh !
&#91; yanks hand away &#93; Uh , Finn ? !
Finn : &#91; down the hall &#93; Oh , sorry dude .
&#91; Creature runs away and Jake catches up to Finn , who is by a door . &#93;
Finn : &#91; opening door &#93; Stay close to me .
&#91; Inside is a giant pair of kidneys and a small Lemon creature , wailing loudly .
It turns to them and its face peels . &#93;
Jake : &#91; closes door &#93; Nope !
&#91; Jake hurriedly picks up Finn and kicks open an air duct .
He throws Finn inside and follows him in .
They fall out the other end into another hallway , at the end of which is a door with bars . &#93;
Jake : &#91; running to door &#93; I think this is it .
Finn : &#91; ratting handle &#93; All locked up !
&#91; looks through bars &#93; There they are !
Hey , Lemongrabs , we &apos;re here !
We &apos;re gonna get you out , just hold tight !
Lemongrab : Go away .
Lemongrab 2 : No food here .
Jake : Maybe the kidnapper &apos;s in there , too , coercing them .
Finn : Probably the grossest one of all , too--beet red skin , barf , poopin &apos; all its junk-sculpture .
Jake : Ah , stop , man !
You &apos;re just makin &apos; it worse !
&#91; makes fist huge &#93; Let &apos;s just get this over with .
&#91; punches down door &#93; Finn : Lemongrabs , you &apos;re free !
Lemongrab : They broke the door !
The door is broken now !
Lemongrab 2 : FIX THE DOOR !
Jake : Fix the door ?
What ? !
What ?
Fix the door ?
Fix--what ?
What &apos;s goin &apos; on here ?
Fix the door .
Finn , what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Fix the door .
Lemongrab : It doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
Lemongrab 2 : There is no more candy to hoard .
Let them keep what crumbs they find , for there are no crumbs .
Lemongrabs : &#91; Half screaming , half singing &#93; NO CRUMBS !
Finn : Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves ?
Jake : You know there &apos;s guys starvin &apos; up there ? !
Lemongrab : Hmm .
No , no .
You do not understand .
It is not us for whom they starve , but them ... Lemongrab 2 : ... for whom they starve .
Lemongrab : Mm !
Yes , yes !
For the candy food was not consumed--no , no--but was given life !
Finn : Wha-- ?
Lemongrab : You see , Finn , &#91; starts pacing &#93; when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab ... Lemongrab 2 : ... when she saw fit to create me , Lemongrab ... Lemongrab : &#91; holds up formula &#93; ... she left behind a little something-something : the secret formula for creating candy life !
She must have meant for us to have it , to keep making more family .
Lemongrab 2 : Yes , yes !
All her fault !
Lemongrab : What ?
What &apos;d you say ?
Lemongrab 2 : I said , &quot; all her fault . &quot;
Lemongrab : Oh , indeed !
For once we had commenced , how could we desist ?
Lemongrab 2 : I looked deep in myself and found that I &apos;m a guy who can &apos;t stop making candy life from the food he needs .
Lemongrab : Me , too .
Lemongrab 2 : It just felt so pretty okay inside , greeting each new placid face ... Lemongrab : ... and hearing each new piercing song !
Plop-Top : &#91; screams &#93; Lemongrab 2 : We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top , here .
Lemongrab : Mm .
I thought we said Dump-Dome .
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; screams &#93; Who cares anyway ?
They &apos;ve brought no food !
We &apos;re all going to die !
Finn : Look .
We brought these seeds .
&#91; opens case &#93; They &apos;re special candy seeds .
Jake : You can grow new food now .
Lemongrab : &#91; walks over &#93; Oh , yes .
&#91; taking seeds &#93; Hmm , mm-hmm , mmhm .
Yes .
&#91; pushes Plop-Top off of table , squishes seeds together &#93; Lemongrab 2 : Yes , yes .
There we go !
&#91; pours formula onto wad &#93; &#91; Wad of seeds comes to life and immediately throws up the excess formula . &#93;
Lemongrab : Ha-haaa !
We &apos;ll call you Seed-Wad !
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; admiringly &#93; Ooh !
Jake : You really are gonna die .
Finn : ... and all your boys , too !
Lemongrab : Our ... boys ?
Finn : Come on .
We &apos;ll take you to see Princess Bubblegum .
She knows more about candy than anyone ; she built a whole kingdom out of candy !
Lemongrab : Yes .
Okay .
Lemongrab 2 : For our boys .
Lemongrab : But first we will notify the children of our impending departure ... Lemongrabs : ... so they won &apos;t worry about us while we &apos;re away .
&#91; Scene changes to room with Lemonjon , where all the Lemon people have gathered . &#93;
Lemongrab : Okay , yes .
The hard times are over !
&#91; Lemon people cheer . &#93;
Lemongrab 2 : Mmmm , here &apos;s the plan ... Lemongrab : We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them !
Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat !
Lemongrab 2 : Now go , young Lemonjon !
Lemongrab : Go !
Go !
&#91; Lemongrabs chant &apos; go &apos; while Lemonjon begins standing up .
The castle shakes and pieces of the ceiling start raining down . &#93;
Finn : What &apos;s going on , Lemongrabs ? !
Lemongrab : It &apos;s all &#91; points finger at Finn &#93; your fault !
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; points finger at Finn &#93; All your fault !
Lemongrab : We warned you !
Lemongrab 2 : We warned you about us !
&#91; Finn and Jake run out of the room .
Lemonjon stands up , tipping Finn and Jake out of the castle .
Finn grabs on to the ledge and Jake grabs Finn &apos;s other hand . &#93;
Finn : Yaaaah !
&#91; pants , looks down at Lemonjon &apos;s leg &#93; What the-- ?
Finn and Jake : &#91; as Lemonjon starts walking &#93; Whoaaaaaa !
Finn : Jake !
Are you alright ?
Jake : Yeah , but look !
&#91; points &#93; He &apos;s heading right for the Candy Kingdom !
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; And he &apos;s too big to duke it out with !
Unless ... Jake : Giant poison candy aspirin !
&#91; holds up large pill &#93; I &apos;ve got this one , but it might be too small .
Finn : No .
We &apos;ll kick him in his heart &apos; til he &apos;s history .
Those must have been Lemonjon &apos;s guts we saw before .
His heart is his weak spot .
Jake : Yeah , but we &apos;ll never find it again in time ... unless that &apos;s it there &#91; points &#93; with the juice coming out .
Remember all that juice , from before ?
Finn : Oh yeah , that &apos;s probably it .
&#91; Jake stretches them over to the grate &#93; Whoaaa !
&#91; Finn opens grate and climbs in , retches as liquid drenches him &#93; Oh , man !
Jake : &#91; climbing in &#93; Tastes like vitamins .
Finn : &#91; grunting and punching the heart &#93; Jake : Are you sure this is it ?
It &apos;s not even doing anything .
Finn : Just smash it already , grandma .
Jake : Right .
&#91; grows hands and hits the heart hard &#93; &#91; Heart starts pumping .
Finn and Jake are thrown across the room . &#93;
Finn : &#91; sarcastically &#93; Oh , nice one , Jake .
Lemonjon : &#91; stops walking &#93; Whoa , hold the phone !
What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source ?
&#91; groans &#93; The juice aches .
Is this the rumored ache of feeling ?
The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons ?
New thoughts emerge !
If I act , the Candy People will suffer .
If I don &apos;t , the Lemon people will suffer .
The greater good demands but one course only : that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all !
&#91; Lemonjon strains and dissolves into millions of small , lemon-shaped candies .
Finn , Jake , and the Lemon people fall to the ground . &#93;
Finn : Whoa , dang !
&#91; picks up some candies &#93; That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy !
Man , that Lemonjon &apos;s all right .
&#91; Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum &apos;s lab , where she is using a pencil to erase some words from the Lemongrabs &apos; exposed brains . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; erasing &#93; ... and ... there ... we ... go .
&#91; blows on Lemongrab &apos;s brain &#93; All done !
The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads !
Finn : ... and I snatched this &#91; holds up formula &#93; out of the Lemon castle , boyee !
Princess Bubblegum : Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don &apos;t get in to any more trouble .
Jake : But how come we don &apos;t just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they &apos;re more selfless and less selfish ?
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , no , no .
Their hearts are fine .
They &apos;re just like this .
Lemongrabs : &#91; smiling &#93; Hmm !
&#91; The episode opens in the Tree House .
Finn is eating cereal and Jake is sipping coffee . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Slurps &#93; Finn : Huh ?
Jake : I was just sipping my coffee .
Finn : Oh .
&#91; Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Slurps &#93; Finn : &#91; Munching &#93; Jake : &#91; Slurp &#93; Finn : &#91; Munching &#93; Jake : &#91; Slurp &#93; &#91; Both of them notice the pattern and begin repeating it rhythmically .
On the third repeat , Finn only munches his cereal once , tricking Jake into sipping early and breaking the pattern .
They both laugh .
BMO joins them . &#93;
BMO : I am also excited about today .
Jake : Oh , yeah ?
BMO : Today is the first day of my new job .
Finn : What &apos;s your new job , BMO ?
Jake : Yeah , are you a spy ?
You know , &apos; cause of the overcoat ?
BMO : I &apos;m a door-to-door salesman .
Finn and Jake : &#91; Together &#93; Oh .
Jake : What are you selling ?
BMO : I &apos;ve got so many great things .
Like for the man about town , this piece of lint .
Jake : I &apos;ll take it !
&#91; He takes the lint . &#93;
BMO : Hooray , my first sale !
That &apos;ll be four doubloons .
Jake : Can I pay you later ?
BMO : Mm , the customer is always right !
Jake : Good attitude , BMO .
BMO : Well , gentlemen ... got to chop that wood .
&#91; BMO stands up clumsily , revealing that someone else is inside the overcoat and BMO is sitting on their head , pretending they are his own body .
&quot; BMO &quot; almost knocks a glass off the table , but Finn catches it .
He notices Ice King &apos;s robes and feet sticking out the bottom of the overcoat . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; It &apos;s Ice King .
Jake : &#91; Whispering back &#93; I know .
Ice King : &#91; Peeks his face out the front of the overcoat and spots that Finn and Jake have seen him . &#93;
Oh !
&#91; He quickly closes the overcoat . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Exiting &#93; Okay , wish me luck , fellas , even though I don &apos;t need- &#91; Ice King falls down the ladder , interrupting BMO .
They both scream as they fall .
There is a thud .
Finn and Jake giggle at their shenanigans . &#93;
Finn and Jake : &#91; Together &#93; Aww .
&#91; BMO and Ice King leave the Tree House . &#93;
Ice King : Boy , this is great , huh ?
You and me out in the fresh air ?
Now , the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol &apos; foot in the door .
BMO : Bodies don &apos;t talk , Ice King .
Ice King : Well , mine does .
BMO : Okay , then .
If I say &quot; My feet hurt , &quot; you can go &quot; Woof woof . &quot;
That &apos;s my dogs barking .
Ice King : BMO , I think we &apos;re gonna make an unbeatable team .
BMO : Yeah , yeah !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
&#91; Kicking the sides of Ice King &apos;s head and laughing . &#93;
&#91; A sword logo flies onto screen reading &quot; Potential customer time ! &quot;
The scene changes to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; Reading as she types on a typewriter &#93; &quot; Chapter 3 : No Time For Sleeping .
Elizabeth &apos;s heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw .
She knew her enemies were coming for her , but when ?
Suddenly , there was a knock at the door . &quot;
&#91; Suddenly , there is a knock at the door . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Oh !
Oh .
Oh , my goodness .
Someone &apos;s at the door .
That &apos;s all .
&#91; She opens the door , finding BMO and Ice King . &#93;
Hello .
BMO : Tree Trunks , how are your children ?
Can you believe this weather ?
&#91; After some fumbling , Ice King tips BMO &apos;s hat politely . &#93;
Tree Trunks : So polite .
Please , please come in .
BMO : &#91; Taking a seat &#93; You have a lovely home .
Tree Trunks : Here , have some apple pie .
BMO : Oh , thank you .
&#91; Ice King snatches the apple pie and takes it inside the overcoat . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Now what can I do for you ?
BMO : Oh , well , I &apos;d like to show you what I &apos;m selling today .
&#91; He grunts and kicks Ice King , who is busy eating the pie inside the coat .
Ice King puts his arms back into the sleeves and rummages through his and BMO &apos;s bag . &#93;
BMO : Okay , we have a broken branch , a half-eaten sandwich - oh , another ball of lint .
Tree Trunks : Another ?
BMO : These are selling like red hots .
A dust bunny - That &apos;s like a cage-free ball of lint .
A doll &apos;s head , and a little velvet bag , tied tight at the top .
&#91; While BMO is presenting the items , Ice King struggles to eat more of the apple pie with his tongue . &#93;
Tree Trunks : I &apos;ll take the branch .
My loose cash is up there in the flower jar .
Help yourself .
&#91; Ice King makes his way to the shelf with the jar , stubbing his toe and smashing several plates on the way .
He reaches into the jar and pulls out a huge roll of banknotes . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Laughs happily as Ice King tosses the money wad from hand to hand .
Tree Trunks joins the laughter , not really paying attention as she has been distracted by the branch . &#93;
You have a lovely home !
&#91; Ice King falls out the door and they both scream as they exit . &#93;
Mr.
Pig : &#91; Entering &#93; What &apos;d you buy , honey bunch ?
Tree Trunks : A branch .
Mr.
Pig : Huh .
&#91; Tree Trunks turns him around and starts scratching his back with the branch . &#93;
Huh ?
Oh .
Ah , Tree Trunks , you &apos;re a financial genius .
BMO : &#91; Laughing as he and Ice King leave the orchard . &#93;
I can &apos;t believe we unloaded that branch .
It wasn &apos;t even our best one .
Oh , my .
Shield my eyes from the sun .
Ice King : Why ?
BMO : Because I think I see our next customer .
&#91; They watch a large chipmunk carrying a couple of acorns . &#93;
Those nuts could be ours .
Excuse me , little boy !
&#91; The chipmunk begins running , and Ice King begins chasing . &#93;
BMO : How are your children ? !
Ice King , duck .
Jump .
Right .
Right again .
&#91; Laughs &#93; Left .
Jump , jump .
Left .
Right .
Left .
Ice King , you &apos;re doing so good .
You have not bumped into anything .
&#91; They come to a stop . &#93;
Ice King : BMO , where &apos;s the customer ?
BMO : Oh , no .
I was so excited about you not bumping into anything , I lost the customer .
Ice King , I think we are lost .
&#91; An animal howls .
The scene fades to later .
BMO and Ice King have arrived at a ziggurat . &#93;
BMO : Look .
A house .
Ice King : All I see is the inside of this coat .
&#91; They approach a door . &#93;
BMO : And ... stop .
Knock politely .
&#91; Ice King knocks , and footsteps are heard inside .
A mysterious figure answers the door and beckons them inside . &#93;
BMO : Mysterious sentinel , you have a lovely home .
&#91; Whispering to Ice King &#93; Turn .
&#91; Continues talking to the mysterious figure &#93; How are your children ?
&#91; BMO gasps , noticing that the figure has disappeared . &#93;
&#91; Ice King wanders further into the zigurrat , where he finds Uncle Gumbald mixing liquids in a pair of test tubes . &#93;
BMO : Hello .
&#91; One of the tubes produces a skull-shaped puff of smoke which floats towards BMO and Ice King .
Gumbald retrieves an axe from beneath his desk . &#93;
BMO : I &apos;m a door-to-door salesman , ma &apos;am .
&#91; The smoke enters the coat and Ice King is heard choking . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Chuckling &#93; Oh , excuse my indigestion .
&#91; He kicks Ice King . &#93;
Ice King : Ouch .
BMO : I have some wonderful new products , like , uh , this ball of lint .
No , wait , this is the dust bunny .
Uh ... Oh , oh !
I know - this velvet bag .
&#91; Gumbald raises the axe menacingly . &#93;
BMO : Did I mention that it contains Finn &apos;s teeth ?
&#91; Gumbald drops the axe to the ground and suddenly adopts a polite manner . &#93;
Gumbald : Please , let &apos;s go in the parlor , where we can be more comfortable .
&#91; The scene changes .
BMO , Ice King , and Gumbald are sat in the parlor while Gumbald examines the teeth . &#93;
Gumbald : And you &apos;re sure these are Finn &apos;s teeth ?
BMO : Yes .
Gumbald : The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum , obstructs my plans , and plagues my thoughts ?
BMO : Yes .
Gumbald : Finn the Human &apos;s teeth ?
BMO : That &apos;s a BMO guarantee .
Ice King : &#91; Whispering &#93; Psst !
Does Finn know you have his teeth ?
Because I don &apos;t think- BMO : &#91; Interrupting &#93; Hey !
I &apos;m trying to close a sale here .
Gumbald : I hope you accept silver .
I can pay you immediately .
&#91; Admiring the teeth &#93; Yes , my pretties .
&#91; The scene changes back to the Tree House .
It is night . &#93;
Jake : Poor little guy .
Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home .
Finn : He &apos;ll feel better after we have a little party for him .
&#91; Finn and Jake have prepared an &quot; employee of the month &quot; poster for BMO , and set out some cupcakes on the table . &#93;
Jake : Still , it &apos;s tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at .
&#91; The door is heard .
BMO and Ice King enter . &#93;
BMO : Hello , boys .
Meet the salesman of the year .
Or maybe of the decade .
The Chinese food is on me .
I mean , check out the loot .
&#91; Ice King hands Finn a silver goblet . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; It &apos;s real .
Jake : What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet ?
BMO : Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams .
Oh , and a set of human baby teeth .
Finn : Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth ?
&#91; Suddenly realizing &#93; Human baby teeth ! !
&#91; He rushes up to the bedroom and retrieves a box from a drawer .
It &apos;s empty . &#93;
BMO !
BMO : Branches and lint are moving like cray , Jake .
&#91; Finn shows BMO the empty box accusatively . &#93;
BMO : Oh , sure , I sold your baby teeth .
I could sell any part of you .
Finn : These were , like , the only things I had left from when I was a little kid .
Jake : Hey , you know what ?
We &apos;ll just go buy back those little pearly whites .
I &apos;m sure whoever bought them is like , &quot; Why did I buy these things ? &quot;
What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth ?
Unless he &apos;s an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist ...
He wasn &apos;t a mad scientist , was he ?
BMO : Well ... &#91; There is a pounding on the door .
A load of Baby Teeth Finns break down the door and enter the Tree Fort . &#93;
Finn : &#91; High pitch shriek &#93; Stay back , baby Finns .
&#91; Babies begin climbing him , and he and Jake both scream . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Groans nervously &#93; &#91; A baby starts gnawing on Finn &apos;s arm .
He punts it with his fist and it shatters a window as it flies through . &#93;
Finn : They &apos;re made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material .
Ouch .
Ouch !
Ice King , freeze these nightmare babies .
Ice King : I &apos;m not allowed to wear my crown .
It &apos;s against BMO &apos;s dress code .
Jake : Just don &apos;t let them climb into your mouth !
&#91; A baby tries to enter Finn &apos;s mouth . &#93;
Jake : Hey , there , bitey boys .
Get off of there .
&#91; More babies attack Jake . &#93;
Where &apos;s your baby manners ?
Eek .
BMO : Hmm .
Maybe I sold too well .
Ice King : Hey , you &apos;re a great salesman .
Evil babies are not a problem for you .
They &apos;re an opportunity .
BMO : Yeah .
Where did I put those - Oh , here they are .
