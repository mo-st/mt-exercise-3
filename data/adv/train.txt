&#91; slips on the gloves and lifts the sphere &#93; I made special gloves for it .
&#91; Finn gives a thumbs up . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; places the sphere around two small creatures &#93; Now check it out !
It &apos;s logging time .
&#91; The creatures blabber indistinctly as one drinks from a thimble .
It sprays the drink upward into a mist and starts kissing the other one as the mist falls over them .
They then continue blabbering . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I &apos;ll set the clock back now .
&#91; swipes her glove &#93; &#91; The two creatures back away as they watch their past selves rewind . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Now I &apos;ll push the time travel button .
&#91; The two creatures scream as their molecules reset to where they were when the sphere was first placed around them .
They continue blabbering . &#93;
Jake : Eh ...
It &apos;s not really time travel , though .
You just , you know , moved their stuff around .
You didn &apos;t really manipulate time .
Ice King &apos;s done it better before ... with magic .
Mudscamp : Well , I enjoyed your presentation very much , Princess .
Thank you for inviting me .
Princess Bubblegum : No !
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess is shown sleeping in the gutter outside . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : For all intents and purposes , they traveled back to an earlier point in their time .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess wakes up . &#93;
Jake : Eh , I guess , but not really .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess peaks through the open window . &#93;
Jake : I mean , Ice King did it for real .
Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess sneaks in and slithers under Jake &apos;s chair . &#93;
Mudscamp : Hey , time , where &apos;s my fiancée ?
Am I right ?
&#91; jingles bell &#93; Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Jake , don &apos;t deny my science .
This is a time travel machine .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s eyes widen .
She throws aside Jake &apos;s chair with him still in it and floats toward the sphere . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me !
&#91; stuffs herself in the sphere , screaming &#93; Princess Bubblegum : LSP ... Lumpy Space Princess : Wha ?
Princess Bubblegum : LSP , that &apos;s not how it works .
It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation , and you need these gloves .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; quietly &#93; Give them to me .
Princess Bubblegum : No .
Lumpy Space Princess : You witch !
Give them to me now !
&#91; pounds table &#93; Princess Bubblegum : No , I &apos;m sorry , but you need to pull yourself to — Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; jumps on her &#93; You skunk !
&#91; tearing out Princess Bubblegum &apos;s hair &#93; You skunk !
You skunk !
You pretty skunk !
You don &apos;t know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum hits her with her crown , knocking her into a bookshelf . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Glob !
&#91; pants &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Hear me , Lumpy Space Princess , I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space , ruled by your parents , if you apologize to me immediately .
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y ... &#91; floats toward the door &#93; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re so &#91; quietly &#93; stupid .
&#91; slams door &#93; Jake &amp; Punch Bowl : Whoa !
&#91; laugh &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Sheesh !
&#91; At the Candy Tavern , Tree Trunks is singing &quot; Slow Boat to China &quot; to Mr.
Pig while various other Candy Tavern People sit around . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Everyone in here is a loser .
Nobody &apos;s as good as Brad .
Oh , Brad !
Why can &apos;t I get over you ?
Bartender : Have you tried burning an effigy ?
That &apos;s what they do in movies .
Lumpy Space Princess : This isn &apos;t a movie , Charlie , it &apos;s real life !
&#91; sighs &#93; Bartender : Another cucumber water , Your Majesty ?
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess nods , and Charlie leaves .
Lumpy Space Princess notices a blue Lumpy Space Person staring at her . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : What ?
Lumpy Space Person : Oh , I — I &apos;m sorry for staring , but , uh , I — I know you .
We used to — Lumpy Space Princess : Everyone knows me .
I &apos;m Lumpy Space Princess .
Lumpy Space Person : No , uh , from high school .
W-we were lab partners .
I &apos;m Johnnie .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugly Johnnie ?
Johnnie : Y-yeah , uh , you used to call me that quite a bit .
Lumpy Space Princess : Yeah , but I can &apos;t call you that anymore !
Come on , sit up straight .
Lemme see them eyes .
Johnnie : Mm .
Lumpy Space Princess : Do it .
&#91; He sits up straight and stares at Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Nope .
Can &apos;t call you that anymore .
&#91; laughs and pounds the bar &#93; So , what brings you to the Candy Kingdom , Johnnie ?
Johnnie : Business , uh , actually .
I own my own company , bottling and distributing Lumpy gas .
Lumpy Space Princess : Mm-hmm .
&#91; moves her chair closer to his &#93; Johnnie : And I &apos;m up for a big contract , uh , here in the kingdom , which could really help my business &quot; take off , &quot; so to speak .
Lumpy Space Princess : That &apos;s so cool .
You &apos;re like your own boss or whatever .
Johnnie : To be honest , I &apos;m a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow .
Lumpy Space Princess : Why , Johnnie ?
Johnnie : I &apos;m bad at talking to people .
Lumpy Space Princess : That &apos;s because you have poor posture .
Johnnie : Really ?
Lumpy Space Princess : You gotta stop slouching !
&#91; Johnnie sits up straight . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Now look me in the eye !
&#91; He does so . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Yeah , stay like that .
Johnnie : Boy , LSP , heh , you sure are making me feel good about myself .
Lumpy Space Princess : You feeling good makes me feel good , Johnnie .
So ... where are you staying while you &apos;re in town ?
Johnnie : I &apos;m sub-letting a friend &apos;s apartment .
Lumpy Space Princess : Talk is cheap , Johnnie .
You should take me there .
&#91; They arrive at Johnnie &apos;s apartment .
Johnnie points to a chair . &#93;
Johnnie : That chair — oh , it used to be over there , but I moved it .
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie , it &apos;s so nice .
You &apos;ve really made it your own .
Johnnie : Thanks .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ooh , records !
&#91; goes through the records and pulls out one with a face &#93; Okay , wanna see something funny ?
Johnnie : Yeah .
Lumpy Space Princess : Okay .
Okay .
&#91; laughs &#93; Sit down !
&#91; The two sit on the couch . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Okay , are you ready ?
Johnnie : Heh-heh , yeah !
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; laughs &#93; Okay !
&#91; puts record over her face &#93; Johnnie : &#91; laughs &#93; It &apos;s his face , but on your body !
Lumpy Space Princess : I know !
That &apos;s the joke .
My friend Melissa and I came up with that .
You &apos;re smart that you get it .
Johnnie : Boy , when this evening started , I was feeling so dump trucks , but now it &apos;s like a hundred forklifts !
Lumpy Space Princess : I feel the same way , Johnnie .
Johnnie : Do you feel this couch ?
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; laughs nervously &#93; What ?
Johnnie : &apos; Cause it &apos;s where you &apos;re gonna sleep !
&#91; They both laugh . &#93;
Johnnie : Seriously .
It &apos;s getting late , and I don &apos;t want you walking home .
So I insist .
I &apos;ll be in the other room , sleeping peacefully ... and dreaming about you .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; embarrassed &#93; Johnnie ... Johnnie : Thank you ... for everything .
&#91; kisses her hand &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie ... go to bed already .
You have a big day tomorrow .
Johnnie : Good night !
&#91; turns off light and closes door &#93; &#91; In the morning , Johnnie opens his door . &#93;
Johnnie : Rise and shine !
I hope you like pancakes &apos; cause I got — &#91; sees empty couch &#93; oh .
&#91; sadly &#93; I guess she &apos;ll be the one who got away .
&#91; turns and sees Lumpy Space Princess in the kitchen &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Looking for someone ?
Johnnie : You &apos;re still here !
Lumpy Space Princess : &apos; Course I am !
Now make me some breakfast !
&#91; drums table &#93; &#91; After breakfast &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Okay , Johnnie , good luck at your meeting .
And remember , I &apos;ll be right over there , &#91; points to couch &#93; sending you good vibes while you &apos;re wowing Princess Bubblegum .
&#91; Her words echo in Johnnie &apos;s head as he sits in a chair waiting for the meeting . &#93;
Banana Guard : Yo , why are you so confident , man ?
Aren &apos;t you nervous to meet the princess ?
Johnnie : Nope !
My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes .
&#91; At Johnnie &apos;s apartment , Lumpy Space Princess is slouched on the couch in front of the TV . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie &apos;s friend has so many movie channels .
&#91; Time card : 45 MINUTES LATER &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Ha-ha , that movie was so dumb .
&#91; looks at nonexistent watch &#93; Oh , poop !
Johnnie &apos;s meeting !
I wonder how it went .
&#91; The light turns on . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie !
Oh , Johnnie , you &apos;re home !
How &apos;d it go ?
Oh , don &apos;t keep me in suspense , Johnnie !
Johnnie : I did it , babe !
I landed the sale !
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie , that &apos;s wonderful !
Johnnie : And I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Lumpy Space Princess : I know !
Johnnie : And here &apos;s the best part !
She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , my Glob !
It &apos;s gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle .
It &apos;s been a while .
Johnnie : Oh .
No .
It &apos;s a business meeting , not social .
Just me and the princess , I &apos;m afraid .
Lumpy Space Princess : What ? !
&#91; storms out &#93; Johnnie : LSP ?
Lumpy Space Princess : So ... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory ?
Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions ?
&#91; floats by a mudscamp &#93; Yo , think again , tranch .
Mudscamp : Who — who are you talking to ?
&#91; The scene cuts to the royal dinner . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom ?
Johnnie : Oh , it &apos;s just great .
I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern .
Princess Bubblegum : That &apos;s wonderful , Johnnie .
Now tell me more about gas ... Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; watching from outside &#93; Oh , Johnnie ...
Ugly Johnnie , through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly .
&#91; sighs &#93; Every relationship , I gamble with my heart .
I go all in because the payoff is true love .
I see you when I close my eyes , and thinking of you makes my mind feel light .
All my problems fade away , and I can &apos;t help smiling .
Heh .
To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person .
I don &apos;t know ... if I can be that big .
&#91; lights Molotov cocktail and throws it through a window &#93; Rah !
&#91; pulls wires from beneath a truck , causing it to roll &#93; Eh , ehh .
&#91; The truck rolls up the castle steps and explodes inside , rocking the whole castle . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; gasps &#93; We &apos;re under attack !
&#91; runs out &#93; Johnnie : Can I help ?
Princess Bubblegum : No .
Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth .
There &apos;s cyanide-laced gum under the table .
Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door .
&#91; closes door &#93; Johnnie : Okay .
&#91; hides under table &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; lifts up tablecloth &#93; Hi , Johnnie .
Johnnie : &#91; gasps &#93; What are you doing here ?
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern — back to when you loved me — so we can have a second chance .
Johnnie : What ?
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess places the sphere around Johnnie &apos;s head and pushes a button on her glove , sending Johnnie &apos;s head &apos;s molecules into limbo . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Uh !
&#91; does the same to Johnnie &apos;s body &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; At the site of the explosion , Manfried is fighting the fire with a garden hose . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Manfried , where are the Banana Guards ?
Manfried : Take a chill pill , Princess .
I handled it .
Princess Bubblegum : What did you handle ?
Manfried : You know .
Someone drove their car in the door , but no one was driving , and it exploded , so I handled it .
Princess Bubblegum : Mmm .
&#91; runs back to the dining room and kicks down the door &#93; Don &apos;t chew it !
Don &apos;t chew it !
Don &apos;t chew it !
&#91; flips table , finding the time travel machine &#93; &#91; At the Candy Tavern , Tree Trunks is still singing the same song while Lumpy Space Princess is looking around expectantly . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie ?
C &apos;mon .
Sit up straight .
Let me see them eyes .
Ha-ha .
Uh .
Princess Bubblegum : He &apos;s not here .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; gasps &#93; What ?
But I sent him back .
Princess Bubblegum : The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function .
Lumpy Space Princess : Well , then where is he ?
Princess Bubblegum : I don &apos;t know .
&#91; Johnnie &apos;s head begins materializing in the border around the screen . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; crying &#93; Then if he &apos;s gone , can you send me back ... ?
&#91; Johnnie &apos;s body materializes in the border . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : To before I met him so I won &apos;t have to remember this heartache ? !
Princess Bubblegum : If that &apos;s what you want .
Lumpy Space Princess : Do it .
Do it !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum places the sphere around Lumpy Space Princess and pushes buttons on her glove , sending Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s molecules back to when she first entered the sphere .
Meanwhile , in the border , Johnnie reunites his head and body . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : You witch !
Give them to — huh , wha ?
What ?
Where are we ?
&#91; Johnnie reaches out to Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : You asked me to use this .
Lumpy Space Princess : Don &apos;t touch me !
&#91; floats away &#93; You pretty skunk !
You don &apos;t know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns ... !
&#91; floats out the window &#93; &#91; Johnnie bows his head , crestfallen , as the border fades to black . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; sighs &#93; &#91; sits down and pours herself a drink &#93; &#91; Episode starts at Finn and Jake &apos;s Tree Fort .
BMO climbs into a dark room with assorted objects . &#93;
BMO : Hello ?
&#91; BMO climbs down a ladder to get into the room .
He finds a cardboard box and hides underneath it .
He starts chuckling .
On his screen , a digital hand selects some files .
The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can , deleting them .
BMO &apos;s screen glitches , and BMO seems woozy .
He chuckles and then looks normal .
Scene switches to outside of the box .
We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box .
He still seems dizzy .
We see him selecting the file &quot; CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys &quot; and then deleting it .
The scene shows his face , which turns from a smile into a frown .
BMO &apos;s screen glitches out wildly as BMO moans .
BMO gets up and wanders around for a second , before falling over .
The screen is blank . &#93;
Finn : BMO ?
&#91; Scene shows Finn and Jake looking down at something .
The image is distorted . &#93;
Jake : BMO ?
&#91; BMO is lying in a bed .
BMO wakes up . &#93;
Finn : BMO , are you okay ?
Jake : What did you do ?
BMO : It wasn &apos;t me .
I didn &apos;t do noth- do noth- do nothing .
&#91; BMO repeats &apos; do noth- &apos; because of his system glitching . &#93;
Finn : Come on BMO .
We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs .
BMO : No , no .
I am fine .
Really .
&#91; BMO &apos;s screen glitches out and BMO yells in pain .
He emits smoke and stops glitching . &#93;
Oh , yes .
Okay .
Please take me to get fixed .
I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed .
We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands , where I was born .
Finn : The MO Factory ?
BMO : Yeah .
I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there .
Come on !
There &apos;s no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose .
&#91; Scene changes to Bad Lands , just outside the MO Co . BMO is telling Finn and Jake where to go . &#93;
BMO : Okay .
Now straight down this place .
Okay , now take a right- right- right- right- left up here .
The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs .
Don &apos;t let on what happened ... or all the years we &apos;ve been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven !
Finn : Tears in the oven ?
&#91; gloomy sounds &#93; But memories are real , real cruc &apos; &#91; ial &#93; !
BMO : Yeah , no fooling .
Oh wait , there &apos;s more !
It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory .
Wait what ?
Oh , that &apos;s just great .
Jake : Hey , hey .
Don &apos;t worry buddy .
We &apos;re Finn and Jake , remember ?
Or should I say ... &#91; Jake transforms into a MO . &#93;
Finn and JMO !
BMO : &#91; laughs &#93; Wow !
Finn : Hey BMO , check this out , too !
&#91; Finn puts his backpack on BMO &apos;s arms .
He pulls his arms into his sleeves and pulls his shirt up over his head and over BMO &apos;s legs , making it seem like Finn has BMO for a head . &#93;
Meet FMO .
BMO : Finn , you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re da man !
This is gonna be a snap !
&#91; Scene changes to inside of the entrance of the MO factory .
Finn falls over . &#93;
Jake : Hello , there .
DMO : Greetings , and welcome to MO Co .
I &apos;m DMO .
Please state your business .
Jake : Hey there , DMO .
I am JMO .
Finn : And I &apos;m FMO !
DMO : Greetings , JMO .
FMO , you look ridiculous .
Are you damaged ?
Are you in need of repair ?
Finn : Yes , absolutely .
Thanks , DMO .
I busted my core system drivers , and now I need new ones .
DMO : Fantastic .
Okay .
Please get ready for your total personality wipe .
&#91; A hole opens in the wall beside DMO and an EMO comes out , twirling a lasso . &#93;
Finn : Oh , right , right .
Uh , right .
I mean , no .
I &apos;m just here for the ... nostalgic purposes .
DMO : Ah , yes .
47.3 % of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz .
Please step 100 % on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour .
&#91; Finn and Jake step onto the tram .
DMO is lowered from his original position , and a chair pops up on the tram , bringing up DMO to the driver seat . &#93;
DMO : Greetings .
&#91; He starts the tram . &#93;
Finn : Wup !
DMO : We are now passing over the famous factory floor .
Birthplace of each and every MO .
Behold the gleaming machinery !
Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation .
From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO .
Jake : But nothing &apos;s moving down there .
It &apos;s all shut down .
What happened to this place ?
DMO : I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m just a tram MO .
I &apos;m not programmed to understand that question .
Also , you &apos;re just a JMO .
You &apos;re not programmed to ask that question .
Jake : Uh , what question ?
DMO : That question- &#91; grunts with frustration &#93; Jake : I &apos;m serious ... DMO : Anyway , MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago .
By Moseph Mastro Giovanni .
A sad and gentle man .
Beloved by only those he built to belove him .
On your left , you &apos;ll see the core system driver installation port bay .
BMO : &#91; gasps &#93; Finn !
Finn !
That &apos;s it !
That &apos;s where the driver ports are !
Finn : I know , I heard !
&#91; Finn jumps off of the tram and into the room along with Jake . &#93;
DMO : What ? !
Are you crazy ? !
Get back here !
&#91; The room has outlets in the back of the wall .
They each correspond to a different MO from AMO-GMO .
The B port is covered up . &#93;
Jake : Hurry , Finn .
I think he &apos;s calling the police or somethin &apos; !
Finn : None of these ports fit right !
E , D , C , where &apos;s the B port ? !
&#91; Outside of the room where the trams travel , a new tram drives up , carrying four SMOs . &#93;
SMO 1 : Intruder spotted !
<unk> to <unk> !
<unk> !
&#91; The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room .
Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves .
SMO 1 : <unk> fire !
No <unk> spotted .
<unk> complete .
SMO 2 : Um , but what if they <unk> past us , sir ?
In all the smoke ?
SMO 1 : <unk> , everyone .
About face .
&#91; All four SMOs turn around . &#93;
Does anyone see the <unk> now ?
&#91; The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks <unk> . &#93;
Like I said , <unk> complete .
Now let &apos;s head back to <unk> .
It &apos;s donut o &apos; clock .
&#91; Scene changes to a kind of <unk> kitchen .
There is a table with <unk> , a vending machine , a refrigerator and a <unk> . &#93;
SMO 3 : Man , how about those goofs ?
<unk> &apos; to mess with our drivers ?
SMO 4 : Yeah .
You know the world these days .
All goofs .
&#91; SMO 4 takes his gun and gets donuts out of the vending machine with it . &#93;
SMO 1 : Hey !
You toss me one of them &apos; nuts ?
&#91; SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen , as if to drink it . &#93;
Ah .
Yeah , hey , speaking of goofs ?
<unk> &apos;t seen SMO <unk> lately .
SMO 3 : &#91; while rubbing a coffee mug on his side &#93; Man , that goof .
SMO 1 : Yeah , I hate that goof .
&#91; SMO 1 rubs the donut on his screen like he is eating it . &#93;
You ever notice goofs always askin &apos; how you &apos;re doin &apos; ?
What is that ?
Uh , yeah , I &apos;m fine .
SMO 3 : Yeah , 100 % .
&#91; SMO 4 tries to throw donuts straight from the bag into his mouth , but they keep hitting the screen and falling to the floor .
From somewhere in the room , the sound of feet walking gets SMO 1 &apos;s attention . &#93;
SMO 1 : Oh !
Hey , what are you doing over there by yourself ?
&#91; An SMO with an orange screen and orange legs turns around . &#93;
SMO 5 : Uh , oh , I-- I &apos;m sad .
SMO 1 : Oh , yeah , y &apos;know we &apos;ve all been there .
&#91; to the other SMOs : &#93; So anyway , how &apos;s your <unk> wife doin &apos; ?
&#91; The scene pans over to SMO 5 .
We see the inside of SMO 5 , which is really just Finn , BMO , and Jake hiding inside an SMO shell .
They are using Jake as the face and legs of the SMO . &#93;
Finn : &#91; whispering : &#93; BMO , how are you doing ?
BMO : Get me close to that guy &apos;s port .
I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is !
&#91; BMO &apos;s screen shows him <unk> . &#93;
Jake : Ah , we gotta hustle !
SMO 1 : &#91; in response to something someone else said : &#93; Yeah , pretty good , I guess .
I <unk> something <unk> .
The wife is always giving me grief about that .
But I mean , what am I , <unk> ?
&#91; Inside the SMO shell , while SMO 1 is talking , Jake takes a cord from BMO and plugs it into the back of SMO 1 .
Suddenly , SMO 1 &apos;s face is shocked and is then frozen as BMO <unk> the file &quot; <unk> &quot; .
He starts shaking . &#93;
SMO 4 : Hey , what are you two goofs doin &apos; ?
<unk> ?
&#91; We see inside the SMO shell again , and we see the map on BMO &apos;s screen .
The map <unk> down to the bottom . &#93;
Jake : Dang , man , how deep does this place go ?
Finn : Down , right , left , down , corkscrew , down .
&#91; <unk> it : &#93; Down , right , left , down , corkscrew , down .
&#91; They throw down SMO 1 and jump out of the shell . &#93;
Finn : <unk> !
&#91; Finn , Jake , and BMO start running away . &#93;
SMO 3 : Hey , woah !
&#91; The three get to a metal grate . &#93;
Finn : Down that grate !
&#91; Jake breaks it and they go under it .
We see <unk> SMOs after them , telling them to stop .
The scene changes to below the grate .
The three fall down perfectly <unk> with the tram , driven by DMO .
They land right on top of it .
They look behind them and see an SMO <unk> his head out of the ceiling . &#93;
DMO : Hey !
Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000 % !
&#91; DMO walks down to where Finn , Jake , and BMO are . &#93;
Get off of my tram !
Jake : <unk> your tram !
&#91; Jake <unk> to DMO &apos;s size .
He runs over and kicks DMO off of the tram . &#93;
<unk> !
&#91; Finn turns to look at him and gives smiles at him , <unk> his fists in the air .
Jake pulls a lever by the driver &apos;s seat , making them go even faster .
Finn laughs and looks down at BMO . &#93;
Finn : Hang in there , BMO !
&#91; BMO flashes a weak thumbs up on his screen . &#93;
Finn : Hey , Jake !
Can this thing go any <unk> &#91; Finn is <unk> by an explosion behind him .
He and BMO are thrown to the front of the tram . &#93;
Finn : Woah !
Shoot , it &apos;s the <unk> !
&#91; Behind them , a tram with ten SMOs and DMO is following them . &#93;
DMO : Hit &apos; em again !
&#91; The SMOs shoot the tram .
Almost half of the tram is gone . &#93;
Finn : <unk> Jake : Finn , how are we getting to BMO &apos;s driver port ? !
Finn : Uh , turn right !
&#91; Jake turns the tram right .
The SMOs tram continues forward , but using a <unk> , they get behind them again . &#93;
Finn : Dog it , they &apos;re still behind us !
&#91; &quot; They drive through a <unk> DNA-like path .
<unk> a <unk> of DNA , there is only one <unk> part .
Finn and Jake are driving in a straight line down the middle of the &apos; DNA &apos; as the SMOs tram <unk> around them . &#93;
Finn : Turn left !
&#91; They drive through a road beneath another .
The SMO &apos;s tram goes on the top road . &#93;
Finn : Turn <unk> !
&#91; They now drive in a <unk> DNA-like path .
This time , there is two <unk> .
The two trams <unk> around each other .
Eventually , they <unk> into one track . &#93;
Finn : Now go down !
&#91; Jake makes the tram face completely downward .
Finn , Jake , and BMO fall off .
Jake stretches into a shield below them .
They break through three different <unk> .
One room has a B port , but they fall too quickly . &#93;
Finn : There &apos;s a driver port !
&#91; In the last room they fall through , Jake turns into a <unk> .
They land on the floor of a huge , white room .
Finn and Jake groan with their <unk> from falling . &#93;
Finn : Too spicy .
Jake : My <unk> !
&#91; Behind them , ten SMOs and DMO from the tram fall through the ceiling , crashing on top of one another . &#93;
SMO 6 : <unk> are forbidden in this facility !
BMO : &#91; weakly : &#93; I am not <unk> .
&#91; SMO 6 still charges his laser gun &#93; BMO : &#91; <unk> : &#93; I am BMO !
&#91; SMO 6 shoots his laser at the ceiling so he doesn &apos;t shoot anybody . &#93;
SMO 6 : &#91; whispering , in awe : &#93; BMO .
&#91; A light flashes in the faces of the SMOs . &#93;
Moe : BMO ?
Did I hear BMO ?
Jake : Wait , what &apos;s up ?
&#91; We see the lights are coming from a room with MMO and Moe .
MMO takes Moe out of his chair and <unk> him .
MMO carries him down to where Finn , Jake , the SMOs and where DMO is , with little unknown MOs <unk> behind , holding life <unk> equipment and tools &#93; Moe : Hey , I &apos;m Moe !
&#91; Moe taps MMO twice on the head .
MMO drops him .
Moe laughs . &#93;
Don &apos;t worry !
My legs don &apos;t work !
Finn : You &apos;re Moe ? !
Wait , are you human , too ?
Moe : My skin is human !
Jake : Dude , how old are you ? !
Moe : Hey , come on , now !
&#91; Moe crawls over to where BMO is .
He turns him so BMO is sitting down . &#93;
It is BMO !
Looks like there &apos;s some <unk> problems !
&#91; Moe turns BMO off .
He opens his face plate .
He looks at the inside of him with a frown . &#93;
Hmm .
Finn : So ... you made BMO ?
Jake : &#91; Jake stretches to a large size . &#93;
Hey , you &apos;re not gonna reset our friend &apos;s personality , are you ?
Moe : Huh ?
What ?
No ... BMO &apos;s one of a kind .
I built BMO to take care of my son .
&#91; A CMO brings over a <unk> . &#93;
Oh , thank you .
But I guess I never ended up dating any women .
So , that &apos;s sad .
&#91; Moe chuckles . &#93;
I sent BMO off into the world alone .
&#91; Moe coughs a couple of times while saying : &#93; <unk> to find a family home .
And then maybe even find somebody else &apos;s little boy to take care of .
Finn : Aw .
Moe : Oh , there &apos;s that <unk> driver disk !
&#91; A CMO is holding a small <unk> disk . &#93;
Thank you .
&#91; The CMO gives him the <unk> sign and smiles . &#93;
&#91; Moe puts the disk drive into a <unk> in BMO .
Some lights flash .
The system shoots the disk back out . &#93;
That <unk> done it .
I must &apos;ve built what , like , a million MOs .
But BMO is very , very special .
I built BMO to understand fun .
And how to play .
&#91; extends an arm and something makes a <unk> sound &#93; You see , I made BMO to be more .
&#91; Moe turns BMO on . &#93;
BMO : Ooh !
Are you my <unk> ?
Moe : Nah , I &apos;m just your poop .
&#91; BMO gasps and runs up to Moe to give him a hug . &#93;
Jake : Wait , did you say you built a million <unk> ?
Finn : Yeah , all we saw was that tram jerk and all those <unk> security jerks !
Moe : Ah , those were just the surface jerks .
&#91; to MMO : &#93; Up , please .
&#91; MMO lifts him up over himself .
He carries him over to a <unk> in the ground with a wheel . &#93;
<unk> , come over here .
&#91; He turns the wheel and the scene shows what &apos;s inside .
There are a couple hundred MOs <unk> about .
We see a <unk> watering plants , an unknown MO with wings , two <unk> throwing <unk> and money , two <unk> playing jump rope with an <unk> while a <unk> , <unk> , and three <unk> MOs looking at them . &#93;
BMO , say hello to your family .
BMO : Hello , family .
&#91; All of the MOs turn up to look at him . &#93;
MOs : Hi , BMO !
&#91; BMO puts his hands on his smiling face . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn and Jake fighting a group of <unk> Guys .
Finn <unk> <unk> at a couple with what is left of his Demon Blood Sword while Jake punches and kicks them away . &#93;
Finn : Thanks , bro !
Jake : There for you , bro ... but Finn , I &apos;m gonna tell you something gently .
Finn : &#91; concerned &#93; Okay .

Jake : Get a new sword .
Finn : What you do mean ?

Jake : Bro ... Finn : I love this sword .
&#91; hugs it &#93; Jake : It &apos;ll be okay .
Let &apos;s go <unk> !
&#91; The scene switches to a marketplace , where several townspeople are selling their <unk> . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : Candles !
Candles !
Candles for all <unk> !
Jake : Hey !
There &apos;s Choose Goose !
&#91; looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly &#93; Goose !
Come on !
&#91; realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him &#93; Finn ?
What &apos;s wrong ?
Finn : Mm , maybe we should try someone else .
Jake : What ?
But we have history with him — that &apos;s important in business .
Finn : Yeah , but we &apos;re lookin &apos; for a sword .
Remember that armor he sold us ?
&#91; motions his hands in the shape of an <unk> &#93; Jake : &#91; winces &#93; Ooh .
Yeah , okay .
&#91; The two walk on . &#93;
Jake : I asked around .
This is the place to get <unk> .
&#91; motions to a grass tipi in front of them &#93; Finn : Oh .
Doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s open .
&#91; The tipi opens , revealing an &quot; OPEN &quot; sign . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : Open !
&#91; They walk inside . &#93;
Voice : Close the curtains behind you , please .
&#91; Finn does so . &#93;
Voice : <unk> towards the candle .
&#91; They approach the man at the <unk> , who is wearing sunglasses and a cloak . &#93;
Man : How can I help you ?
Finn : Need a sword .
Man : Hold on .
&#91; brings out a sword &#93; Here you go : a grass sword .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Finn : I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve never used a grass sword before .
Maybe we should keep lookin &apos; .
Man : <unk> like this don &apos;t come around every day .
Finn : Don &apos;t come around every day , uh ?
&#91; <unk> the sword &#93; I love it .
Jake : Well , that was easy .
Man : &#91; as Finn and Jake walk out &#93; Remember , no take backs .
&#91; Finn <unk> with the sword as a townsperson pushes up a cart <unk> with <unk> . &#93;
Jake : Hey , the pillow <unk> !
&#91; The scene changes to Finn and Jake walking through the woods .
Jake is carrying a pillow while Finn is practicing with his sword .
Suddenly , a pizza flies out of the bushes . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Hyut !
&#91; slices it in half &#93; Jake : Huh ?

Finn : Yeah !

Jake : He &apos;s gettin &apos; really good .
He saved me from pizza .
Tree Trunks : That apple slicing is too perfect ... <unk> perfect .
That sword is cursed !
Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; laugh &#93; Jake : I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious .
&#91; The scene changes to inside Finn and Jake &apos;s bedroom .
Finn is practicing with his sword while wearing pajamas and Jake is making his bed . &#93;
Jake : Uh , how &apos;s that curse doin &apos; ?
<unk> &apos; you want to <unk> me ?
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : No , man .
This sword doesn &apos;t seem to have any curse on it , as far as I can tell .
&#91; stabs at the air &#93; Hyah !
Jake : Well , okay .
&#91; tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth &#93; Dang tag .
Finn : I got it !
Jake : Hmm ?
&#91; Finn quickly slices at the tag with his sword .
The tag falls apart as it is revealed that the sword cut it in the shape of Finn &apos;s face . &#93;
Jake : &#91; gasps &#93; Finn : Whoa !
Jake : Hey , <unk> <unk> &apos; off , bro !
Finn : Sorry , man .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I-I ...
I &apos;ll go put this away .
Jake : Good idea .
&#91; puts the pillow in his bed , gets on top of it , and starts sleeping &#93; &#91; Finn puts the sword in a chest .
The scene switches to him in bed , moaning softly in his sleep .
In his dream , the sword emerges from the grassy field , <unk> , and reforms in his hand .
The sword wiggles , and grass starts spreading over Finn &apos;s body .
Finn screams but is muffled by the grass .
His whole body becomes like <unk> , then blows away in the wind .
Finn wakes up . &#93;
Finn : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; pants &#93; Huh ?
&#91; <unk> sleeping bag , finding the sword in his hand &#93; &#91; The sword extends grass from the hilt onto Finn &apos;s wrist , <unk> itself around his arm . &#93;
Finn : What the — ?
&#91; pants frantically &#93; &#91; He runs outside and shrieks , <unk> the sword around in an attempt to get it off .
He runs into the forest and bites some of it off , but it grows back .
He covers his left hand with his pajamas and <unk> to pull it off his right hand . &#93;
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; Jeez .
&#91; The sword extends its grassy hands toward him , trying to <unk> itself .
Finn drops it and kicks it toward a cliff . &#93;
Finn : <unk> ... &#91; kicks it &#93; thing !
&#91; It falls into the river below . &#93;
<unk> three bucks I &apos;ve ever spent .
&#91; The scene changes back to Finn in his bed .
He suddenly wakes up . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; looks at his arm , seeing no sword &#93; Whew .
&#91; In the bathroom , he <unk> his teeth and opens the <unk> for some <unk> .
As he closes it , he sees the sword behind him in the mirror , still <unk> wet . &#93;
Finn : &#91; shrieks &#93; Jake : What &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Finn : The sword is after my flesh !
Jake : Huh ?
&#91; The sword wiggles its <unk> . &#93;
Jake : Oh , snap !
Finn : Don &apos;t let it get me , Jake !
Jake : Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll handle this .
&#91; wraps his <unk> around the sword &apos;s hilt and <unk> it in a <unk> &#93; There .
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; Let &apos;s go return that junk .
&#91; At the marketplace , the place where the grass tipi was is now a patch of dirt with a &quot; FOR <unk> &quot; sign in the middle . &#93;
Jake : Huh .
Hey , he &apos;s not here .
Finn : Hmm .
Maybe someone around here knows where he is .
&#91; They hear screams for help from offscreen . &#93;
Finn : Somebody in trouble !
&#91; They run toward the source of the cries . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : Help !
They &apos;re taking our candles !
Jake : It &apos;s the Hooligans Who Love Candles !
Finn : Let &apos;s get &apos; em !
&#91; drops his pack and sword &#93; Hey !
Hooligans carrying candle : Huh ?
&#91; Finn kicks the candle out of their grip . &#93;
Hooligan : Yo !

Finn : Stealing candles from old ladies is <unk> !

&#91; throws candle at Finn &#93; Finn : &#91; catches it and throws it back &#93; <unk> !
&#91; kicks him &#93; Hyah !
&#91; Jake runs by chasing two more hooligans . &#93;
Hooligans : Aah !
Stop chasing us !
&#91; Finn continues fighting , then rests , panting .
A hooligan holding a candle comes up from behind . &#93;
Hooligan : Happy birthday .
&#91; <unk> Finn &apos;s head with candle &#93; &#91; Finn falls to the ground and holds his head .
He looks up to see five of the hooligans upon him . &#93;
Hooligan : &#91; <unk> candle &#93; You &apos;re dead , teddy boy .
&#91; Finn looks down to see the sword wrapped around his wrist again . &#93;
Finn : No .
&#91; The hooligan lifts the candle above his head in slow motion , coming in for another hit , but Finn quickly gets up and slices at the candle <unk> times .
The candle falls apart in the shape of Finn &apos;s face .
While the hooligans are taken <unk> , Finn leaps over them while slicing at their hair .
After he lands , their hair falls off and they run away screaming . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : You &apos;ve saved our shop !
Sue : Thank you so much , you <unk> young man .
Suzy : And don &apos;t even worry about the <unk> .
Sue : We &apos;ll just use the broken pieces to build a <unk> candle in your <unk> .
Suzy : Oh , and we &apos;ll put it right by the entrance , and it &apos;ll be our <unk> — the candle man !
&#91; The sword <unk> Finn &apos;s wrist <unk> . &#93;
Jake : Dude ... &#91; winces &#93; Finn : Yeah ... not comin &apos; off .
Jake : Don &apos;t give up , man .
Hey , maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went .
&#91; The scene changes to them walking up to Choose Goose &apos;s <unk> . &#93;
Jake : Hey , <unk> !
We need your help .
We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword .
You know who he is ?
Choose Goose : I know you did business with some <unk> guy .
Help you <unk> — Why should I ?
Jake : What ?
Come on , <unk> , it was only one time .
Choose Goose : Hmm .
&#91; Finn slices at a fly , but knocks down some of Choose Goose &apos;s <unk> . &#93;
Finn : I made a mistake , <unk> .
This <unk> is totally <unk> .

Choose Goose : <unk> ...

He &apos;s a wizard from the grassy <unk> .
He lives atop the grassy <unk> ... <unk> .
Jake : Awesome .
Wizard of Grassy <unk> ... Mountain .
Yeah , thanks , <unk> .
Finn : Yeah , thanks !
&#91; Finn and Jake start walking off . &#93;
Choose Goose : &#91; shouting after them &#93; He &apos;s the only one who can lift the curse , but <unk> ... &#91; Finn and Jake stop in their tracks and turn around . &#93;
Choose Goose : He &apos;s a huge <unk> — just the worst .
&#91; The scene switches to Finn and Jake running toward the grassy mountain .
Suddenly , some grass monsters emerge from the side of the hill .
Finn slices the head off each one as he runs by . &#93;
Finn : <unk> , chop , chop , chop , chop !
&#91; In front of them , a giant Grass <unk> grows out of the ground .
It growls and spits at them and steps toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; Finn gets Jake out of the way of the monster &apos;s foot and slices its leg in the shape of his face without even looking .
The monster howls while <unk> on one foot .
Finn flicks the blade of his sword , causing it to rapidly spin like a <unk> .
The monster spits at them some more , then <unk> on top of them .
Finn uses the sword to <unk> his way out from under the <unk> of grass .
The blade stops spinning and they continue up the mountain . &#93;
Finn : Hmm .
For a cursed <unk> , you cut so good .
&#91; They reach the shack at the top of the mountain . &#93;
Finn : Come forth , wizard , and <unk> my <unk> !
Grassy Mountain Wizard !
&#91; The door opens and out steps the guy who sold Finn his sword .
He casts aside his cloak and sunglasses . &#93;
Grassy Wizard : Comin &apos; up here tryin &apos; to enter my house !
Are you for real ? !
&#91; uses his powers to bring out his household objects made of grass &#93; <unk> &apos; em down , my cursed grassy objects !

&#91; slices all the objects while running toward the wizard &#93; Grassy Wizard : Uh ... go forth !
Go ... uh , forth .
&#91; looks inside his house &#93; That was all my grassy objects .
&#91; Finn lands in front of him , knocking the wizard backwards . &#93;
Finn : &#91; points his sword at the wizard &#93; <unk> the curse .
Grassy Wizard : &#91; laughs &#93; Never !
You have no power over me , young fool !
The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity !
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : &#91; contemplates for a moment &#93; Hmm .
You know what ?
&#91; backs off from wizard &#93; I think I &apos;m cool with that .
&#91; The sword retracts and wraps around Finn &apos;s arm . &#93;
Grassy Wizard : What ?
Finn : Whoa .
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; extends and retracts his sword a few times &#93; Jake : Now that you &apos;ve <unk> it , you can control it !
Finn : &#91; extends it &#93; Yeah .
&#91; retracts it &#93; This is really cool !
&#91; extends it &#93; I just had to get used to it .
&#91; retracts it &#93; Grassy Wizard : That &apos;s not how people are supposed to react to an <unk> curse !
Finn &amp; Jake : <unk> .
&#91; They run down the mountain while Finn retracts and extends his sword . &#93;
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Do it again !
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : Get it , get it !
&#91; A ladybug hisses at him &#93; Finn : &#91; Jumps with a sword . &#93;

He runs up to the ladybug and chops the ground in front of it .
The lady bug climbs onto his sword . &#93;
Jake : Get him out !
&#91; Finn goes outside . &#93;
Finn : Don &apos;t you ever let me catch you here again !

Maybe we &apos;d find my basket in his treasure chest !
Finn : That &apos;s a great idea , Penny !

Good luck , Finn !
Oh , yeah , and that high window is the only entrance .
Finn : Hmm .
Alright , wish me luck !
Jake : She already did , man .
Finn : Oh , yeah .
Right .
&#91; passes through the barrier and starts to climb the tower while Jake cheers him on .
He reaches the window , only to find that there is a rope leading downward &#93; Great , now I gotta climb down ? !
&#91; floor starts to break &#93; Huh ?
&#91; The floor completely breaks and he falls down and screams , eventually hitting a <unk> at the bottom .

Penny : Of course it &apos;s not !
I set you up to steal this chest of gold !
I couldn &apos;t get past the barrier &apos; cause I &apos;m a thief !
Finn : But you &apos;re just a cute little girl !
Penny : And , I &apos;m a thief !
Finn : Well , if this isn &apos;t yours , I &apos;m gonna return it right now !
&#91; closes the <unk> and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back &#93; Huh ?
&#91; puts hand and body against barrier , to no avail &#93; Why can &apos;t I ... ?
Penny : Because you stole something in the city !
Now you &apos;re a thief !
Finn : No !

Finn : Enderman !

&#91; He pulls out the pumpkin pie and realizes he doesn &apos;t have a weapon . &#93;
Oh no .
&#91; As the enderman rushes towards him , Finn closes his eyes and looks down at the ground .
This causes the enderman to stop just in front of him . &#93;
Finn : So , uh ... Do you have , like , another job , or is this what you do full time ?
I saw you carrying that block back there .

Does this guy even have toes ?
Are those his toes ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever even seen a toe , come to think of it .
What am I even talking about ?
&#91; The enderman gets so bored of Lumpy Space Princess &apos; <unk> that they leave . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Suddenly hugs Lumpy Space Princess &#93; Thank you I &apos;ve been stuck here so long !
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Blushing &#93; Haha .

A sheep gets up from where Lemongrab has been using it as a pillow and he wakes up . &#93;
Lemongrab : &#91; Still half asleep &#93; Good morning .

Finn : &#91; Sees that Jake has <unk> the diamonds into a neat pattern . &#93;
Whoa !

Finn : D &apos;aw come on !

&#91; Jake shrugs . &#93;
Oh , duh .

It &apos;s a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to <unk> it again .
&#91; He lights the firework rocket and it explodes <unk> on the ceiling of the mine .

Finn : That &apos;s Jake &apos;s secret , too .

&#91; Goblin King challenges Jake to spitting their spit the <unk> and laughs when Jake throws a pathetic spit &#93; &#91; A monster makes Jake chase a laser <unk> , which leads Jake to bump into a wall &#93; Jake : &#91; voiceover &#93; But you would have blown right through .
I kept thinking to myself , &quot; What would Finn do ? &quot;
Just ... eh , <unk> .

Finn : Yeah ...

&#91; Both chuckle , there &apos;s a moment of silence &#93; &#91; A &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; logo pops up as they awkwardly handshake &#93; Finn : Now let &apos;s find a way out of this cage .

Jake sets the cage &apos;s rope on fire , and it drops on the Guardian Angel , killing her &#93; Jake : Alright , man .
Let &apos;s go !
We &apos;ve still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet !
Finn : Wait !
You &apos;d help me win a bet that I made that I said I could <unk> something without you ?
Jake : Just hop on my <unk> doughnut , boy !

&#91; Finn and Jake hop on her swan , which kills all the eye creatures with laser eyes &#93; Princess Bubblegum : I hope you learned a lesson from all this !
Both : Uh , we learned that working together is better .
Heh , whatever .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum growls &#93; Jake : &#91; whispers to Finn &#93; Looks like that &apos;s not the answer she wanted .
Finn : Uhh ...
I learned that you &apos;re a very ... <unk> princess ?
Princess Bubblegum : You &apos;re <unk> right I am .
Princess Bubblegum , away ! !
&#91; The three break out of the dungeon riding the swan .
&quot; ADVENTURE TIME &quot; logo pops up just as the episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking down a path in a forest . &#93;
Finn : What ... is the meaning of &quot; soup &quot; ?
Jake : What ?

Jake : Yeah , well , sounds like you &apos;re sad .

And there &apos;s a lot of fish in the <unk> .
A lot of fish .
A penny saved is a penny <unk> .
Finn : Yeah , I-I guess .
Or maybe dating girls is like riding a <unk> .
Jake : Yeah , man , yeah !

Finn : Relax , buddy .

Jake wakes up looking at a yellow sky . &#93;
Jake : Huh ?

&#91; A forest , mountains , and a flower grow out of the ground . &#93;
Jake : Pretty neat .
I bet there &apos;s , like — like a cool city or something around here .
&#91; A city grows out of the ground . &#93;
Jake : Nice .

Everyone &apos;s waiting for you at the party .
Jake : Eh — party ?
Goose : No .

&#91; Jake and Goose walk to the party .
Outside the building , a group of people cheer and applaud his arrival , and a <unk> plays a <unk> tune .
A <unk> reads &quot; <unk> <unk> JAKE . &quot;
Inside , <unk> of Jake and his family line the walls , and dozens of <unk> dance .

Jake : &#91; thinking &#93; Guess I &apos;d better not worry about it .
&#91; aloud &#93; Hmm .
I &apos;m hungies , Goose .
Goose : I think there &apos;s a leftover <unk> basket or something in the fridge .
&#91; The building rumbles briefly , knocking down the partially built card houses . &#93;
Goose : &#91; leaving &#93; Just a sec .
&#91; gets food from the fridge and returns &#93; Cold <unk> sandwiches !
&#91; Another <unk> Jake-quake occurs . &#93;
Jake : All right !

Something &apos;s wrong , Goose .
Jakey can &apos;t eat any of these nachos ... &#91; ground rumbles &#93; but Jakey needs nachos !
Aah !
&#91; Someone knocks on the front door .
Jake answers it . &#93;
Urchin : Mr. Jake !
Mr. Jake !

Below us are gathered the city &apos;s top minds .
Jake : Hmm .
Mayor : And they &apos;ve noticed that our <unk> <unk> have increased <unk> since your arrival .
Jake : Mayor , uh , I want to meet these minds .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Mayor and Jake on the floor with the scientists . &#93;
Mayor : Here are some of the minds .
Scientist : Jake , we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes .
Jake : There &apos;s no need .
I &apos;ve got it <unk> out .
The <unk> are happening because Jake is hungry , &#91; pats belly &#93; and his stomach is growling .
And the <unk> he gets , the worse the quakes will become .
&#91; The Mayor and the scientists laugh out loud . &#93;
Jake : I &apos;ll prove it !
Scientists : Huh ?
Jake : <unk> a food <unk> .
Scientist : <unk> .
&#91; The ground rumbles . &#93;
Jake : What &apos;s in the omelet ?
&#91; The ground briefly shakes again . &#93;
Scientist : <unk> !
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> omelet !
&#91; The ground shakes violently .
A large metal pole falls toward them . &#93;
Scientist : Watch out !
&#91; It crashes to the ground , leaving the scientists unharmed . &#93;
Scientist : <unk> , Tim !
Tim : It &apos;s too early to say ; this evidence is <unk> !
Jake : Look , just let me stretch outside to get something to eat , and the quakes will stop .
Tim : That doesn &apos;t sound very <unk> .
Scientist : No , but you have my <unk> to test your idea .
Erik Adamkinson : I don &apos;t like that idea .
Scientists : Huh ?
Erik Adamkinson : If Jake leaves , that would mean the <unk> destruction of our world .
I believe that Jake is an <unk> being , a Glob if you will , whose <unk> field holds our world together .
If he leaves , his flesh will <unk> , and everything and everyone here will disappear completely !
Tim : Oh , Erik Adamkinson , you &apos;re just a <unk> scientist , well known to have a <unk> of crazy <unk> .
Erik Adamkinson : Hm !
Perhaps I am .
And maybe I am wrong ... but are you really <unk> to take that chance ?
We should <unk> Jake immediately !
Jake : What ? !
No way !
The world &apos;s not gonna end just because I go get a <unk> .
&#91; The ground shakes . &#93;
Mayor : <unk> him !
Jake : Uh , peace !
&#91; grows in size &#93; &#91; Several Jake People jump on him and hold him down . &#93;
Jake : Why ? !
Mayor : <unk> him .
&#91; One last Jake Person jumps on Jake , <unk> on Jake &apos;s face .
Jake is now in a tiny cell , <unk> by two Jake People . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sadly &#93; Mm .
&#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> .
&#91; Jake &apos;s stomach growls , and the ground shakes . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : Don &apos;t worry , everybody .
I will <unk> to Jake &apos;s Glob world , which , <unk> would have us believe , lies beyond the great sky-hole , and bring back the food of the globs to <unk> Jake &apos;s <unk> , <unk> saving everybody .
&#91; The crowd cheers .
One Jake Person runs after Erik Adamkinson . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson &apos;s father : Wait !

&#91; hugs Erik Adamkinson &#93; I want to go with you , <unk> !
Erik Adamkinson : I-I &apos;m sorry , Dad .

Your mind is unprepared .
Erik Adamkinson &apos;s father : My son .
&#91; weeps &#93; &#91; Erik Adamkinson climbs to the top of a mountain and then climbs the wall .
A balloon floats next to him . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : Huh ?
&#91; grabs balloon &#93; Yeah !
&#91; The balloon takes him higher . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : There it is , the sky <unk> !
&#91; Erik Adamkinson passes through the sky-hole and climbs onto Jake &apos;s body .

Erik Adamkinson : <unk> !
Oh , my stars !
It &apos;s just as I <unk> !

Do you have <unk> ?
Hello ?
Hmm .
Maybe those aren &apos;t the true globs .
Yeah , they &apos;re too ugly to be — &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; Finn lifts his head with spaghetti hanging out of his mouth and looks at Erik Adamkinson . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : &#91; screams and then weeps &#93; I thought you &apos;d be beautiful .
But you &apos;re not !
&#91; cries &#93; You &apos;re hideous !
<unk> !
&#91; melts into Jake &apos;s body &#93; Finn : &#91; points to <unk> &#93; BMO , <unk> .
&#91; Back in Jake World &#93; Jake : <unk> ... &#91; stomach rumbles &#93; &#91; In the city , the dolls Jake was looking at earlier fall down as people scream in panic .
Outside Jake &apos;s cell , one <unk> is checking his phone , while the other is about to touch him with his <unk> . &#93;
Guard : Don &apos;t !
&#91; The guards hear a slapping sound . &#93;
Guards : Huh ?
&#91; Out of a bush pops Goose , slapping his jowls together .
The guards laugh and run to him . &#93;
Guard : Hey , you &apos;re a <unk> — &#91; Goose smacks them down with his jowls . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Huh ?
&#91; Goose bends the bars of the cell with his jowls . &#93;
Jake : Goose ?
Goose : Go .
Jake : But — but what if Erik Adamkinson is right ?
What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can &apos;t bring you back ?
Goose : Then you won &apos;t have to pay me back that five bucks .
Jake : But — &#91; Goose slaps Jake with his jowls . &#93;
Goose : Go eat , Jake !
&#91; Jake takes a huge breath , steps out of his cell , and stretches straight up .
Goose waves goodbye as he is pulled into the ground .
As Jake grows <unk> , Jake People in the city get pulled into the ground , and then the city gets pulled in .
Jake yells as he continues stretching his way up to the sky hole .
The screen goes black . &#93;
Finn : Uh , Jake ?
What &apos;s going on , man ?
Feeling okay ?
Jake : &#91; eating beans &#93; Just getting a snack , Goose .
&#91; sheds a tear &#93; Just getting a snack .
&#91; The scene begins at the Tree Fort . &#93;
Jake : And as it <unk> through the <unk> that it had <unk> , the vampire smashed their <unk> just for the fun of it !
Finn : No way !
Jake : Yes way , it did .
And also the vampire <unk> over its <unk> and <unk> their <unk> blood mist .
&#91; warbling with tongue &#93; Finn : Ah , jeez !
Jake , is this stuff you &apos;re saying true ?
Or are you just trying to mess me up ?

I was just trying to scare you .
Finn : But you said you heard it from a reliable source !
Jake : Ha ha !
I made that up , too .
I was trying to scare you , and it worked !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; the window blows open by itself , the lights go out , and Jake screams &#93; Finn : No one &apos;s outside .
Jake : Whew !
Finn : It was just the wind , <unk> .
Jake : I wasn &apos;t scared , I was singing .
I was singing my scream song .
Ahh !

Jake climbs upstairs and into his bed . &#93;
Jake : &#91; yawns , smacks lips &#93; &#91; Suddenly , some <unk> and knocking sounds are heard coming from downstairs . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sits up &#93; Finn , was that you ?
Finn : &#91; snores &#93; Jake : &#91; lies back down &#93; Probably just BMO or something .
&#91; The record downstairs is heard playing jazz . &#93;
Jake : That &apos;s weird .
BMO doesn &apos;t like <unk> &apos;s jazz .
&#91; climbs downstairs &#93; Yeesh .

Jake : &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; I didn &apos;t know we had one of those .
Voice : &#91; spookily &#93; Oooooo ... Jake : &#91; panting &#93; Hey , hey .
Hey , who ?
&#91; A ghost fly appears and slowly moves toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : Aah !

&#91; The ghost fly swipes its scythe at him . &#93;
Finn : Come on , dude .

Finn : Aah !
It &apos;s no good .

His phone rings twice ; he <unk> it .
The silhouette , wearing a hat and carrying a bag , approaches the Tree Fort .
Back inside , Finn , Jake , and BMO are hiding inside a suit of armor . &#93;
BMO : Is he coming soon ?
Jake : I think so .
His ways are kind of mysterious .
Finn : That &apos;s cool .
&#91; The ghost fly flies into the suit of armor . &#93;

&#91; throws water at the ghost fly &#93; &#91; The ghost fly dodges it and flies into a hole in the wall . &#93;
Jake : &#91; quietly &#93; Thank you .
Peppermint Butler : &#91; drawing chalk circles around Finn , Jake , and BMO &#93; These circles will protect you from the ghost &apos;s attacks while I prepare the <unk> ritual .
<unk> not , fellow <unk> , for in this bag , I <unk> all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be <unk> in one place .
We &apos;re perfectly safe — as long as ... &#91; the ghost fly picks up the bag &#93; we ... have ... &#91; The ghost fly takes the bag into the hole in the wall .
Peppermint Butler puts his hat on , jumps out the window , and runs away .
The ghost fly comes out and flies toward Jake but is stopped by the circle . &#93;
Jake : Well , huh .
How about that ?
No <unk> .
We &apos;ll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning .
That &apos;s when ghosts go to sleep .
Yep .
Just got to make it ... till morning .
&#91; The ghost fly buzzes in circles around them while wailing spookily .
A time <unk> shows storm <unk> rolling past the Tree Fort .
Eventually , the ghost fly stops . &#93;
Ghost Fly : Woo !
&#91; flies offscreen &#93; &#91; Finn hears the sound of <unk> rustling . &#93;
Finn : Hmm ?
&#91; On the table , the magazine he was reading flips to the page he was on and turns toward him . &#93;

Jake : Dude , what are you — ?
Finn : If I <unk> the circle ... &#91; <unk> old circle &#93; farther ...
I can get closer to the magazine .
BMO : <unk> , that is possible .
Jake : Yeah , but I &apos;m still getting a &quot; <unk> &quot; feeling .
This seems like a bad idea .
Finn : Just have to stay inside this circle .
&#91; From an <unk> <unk> , the &quot; circle &quot; is <unk> an outline of a woman . &#93;
Finn : Ha ha !
How &apos;d you do it , Rusty ?

Jake : What ?
BMO : It &apos;s okay !
I learned it out of a magazine .
Jake : &#91; looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling &#93; Finn ... &#91; to BMO &#93; All right .
But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost .
BMO : Tell me a joke .
Jake : Okay .

Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Whistles . &#93;
Oh , hey , Finn !

Princess Bubblegum : Guards !
&#91; Finn is thrown out of the castle .
Jake comes out of the hole in the lute , breaking the <unk> and falls , dizzy .

Marceline bites the back of the wolf in front of her and Finn does the same .
Finn and Marceline begin to ride on the back of two wolves .
Marceline and Finn fly two wolves to the Candy Kingdom and outside of Princess Bubblegum &apos;s room . &#93;
Marceline : Shhh !
She &apos;s probably asleep !
&#91; They put the wolves into Princess Bubblegum &apos;s room and close the door . &#93;
Finn : This was a really good idea .
Marceline : &#91; Turns into a bat . &#93;
Now don &apos;t blow it this time !
Finn : Haha , okay .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum screams , runs out of her room and struggles to close the door behind her .
She notices Finn . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , Finn , thank goodness you &apos;re here !
There &apos;s wolves in my room !
Finn : Yeah , I know !
I put them there !
Pretty exciting , right ?
Heh heh .

Finn : I don &apos;t understand , Marceline .

&#91; Marceline puts a finger to his lips . &#93;
Marceline : Shhh .
Come on , Finn , a <unk> like <unk> ?
You &apos;ll be bored with her in a week !

Marceline : Uh-oh .
Finn : &#91; Makes guitar noises . &#93;

&#91; She whispers to the ghosts .
Finn and Jake are exhausted from <unk> up and down . &#93;
Finn : Okay , Marceline , we &apos;re ready now .
Marceline : Okay , hold that thought .
&#91; She floats into the next room . &#93;
Georgy : Huhuuuhhuh ... &#91; Marceline floats back into the living room . &#93;
Marceline : I &apos;m gonna perform the biting ritual .
You guys close your eyes and don &apos;t open them until I say so .
If you do ... your heads will <unk> !
Okay , Finn .

&#91; Marceline lifts up Finn &apos;s hat , to reveal his neck .
She then makes a hissing noise as she moves closer .
Then she pinches Finn &apos;s neck .
Finn lets out a <unk> . &#93;
Marceline : <unk> .
&#91; Then Marceline does the same thing to Jake . &#93;

Finn : Ugh .

Jake : Sorry , bro .
&#91; While Finn and Jake aren &apos;t looking , Marceline <unk> drains the red from the apple in Jake &apos;s hands .
After Jake and Finn finish rubbing the mush off their faces , Jake looks down and notices the <unk> fruit . &#93;

&#91; Time seems to pass in slow motion as the baked beans spill all over the ground . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : MY <unk> ! ! !

Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo laugh at the sight . &#93;
Booboo : Time to join in on the fun !
Lumpy Space Princess : You guys ruined everything !

Finn : But we &apos;re undead .
&#91; An axe suddenly appears to float in <unk> .
LSP suddenly gasps and faints at the sight . &#93;
Jake : Geez , we really scared her .
&#91; Finn and Jake gasp as Marceline appears behind them . &#93;

&#91; Marceline stares . &#93;
Georgy : Hey , guys , I think you &apos;re ready to learn how to float .
All you have to do is jump off that ledge .
&#91; He glances up towards some <unk> structures in the distance . &#93;
Finn : Cool .

Like ... uh ... the <unk> vampire walk .

Jake : We wanna fly !
&#91; The ghosts take them away .
Marceline growls in anger and floats after them . &#93;
Marceline : You guys stop right now .
Georgy : Marceline , chill out .
It &apos;s going to be okay .
We &apos;ve got a plan .

&#91; Marceline is <unk> .
Her eyes <unk> with <unk> .
Then she dives off the edge after Finn and Jake , turns invisible , and catches them just before they land on some <unk> glass at the bottom .
Finn and Jake cheer on all the while .
Marceline , still <unk> , drops the two of them <unk> on the ground . &#93;
Finn and Jake : We did it !

Wendy : Way to go , Marceline .
Marceline : Hey , you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends !
Booboo : They gotta die someday .
Wendy : Hey !

Finn : Did you see us ?
Wendy : Yeah , you guys were pretty amazing .
Booboo : Hey , we &apos;re gonna throw a party ... in honor of your new vampire <unk> .
Finn : Holy snaps , that &apos;s awesome !

Finn , Jake , and ghosts : What ?
Booboo : She &apos;s just jealous of you .
&#91; Wendy hands Finn and Jake an <unk> . &#93;
Wendy : We &apos;ll see you at midnight at our place .
&#91; The ghosts turn invisible .
Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline . &#93;
Marceline : Guys , promise me you &apos;re going to that party .
Finn : We &apos;re not gonna go .
Marceline : You &apos;re not ?
Finn : Nah .

Finn : Well , we &apos;re going back home .
Jake : Peace .
&#91; The scene transitions to Jake and Finn standing in the <unk> Forest .
Lightning flashes across the night sky .
A <unk> <unk> stands on top of the hill . &#93;
Finn : Number <unk> , Blood <unk> .
&#91; Finn and Jake enter the <unk> . &#93;

&#91; Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo have changed .
They have <unk> increased in size , are wearing <unk> <unk> , and have <unk> eyes and <unk> lips .
Georgy closes the door .
Then the ghosts join hands , spin around our heroes , and start chanting ominously .
Their eyes and mouths start glowing white . &#93;
Finn : Uh ... &#91; He shrieks in <unk> as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head .
Jake tries to punch the ghosts &apos; mouths away , but one gets him from behind . &#93;
Georgy , what &apos;s wrong ?
Jake , what &apos;s happening ?
Jake : I think they &apos;re testing our vampire <unk> .
Finn : Oh , sweet .

&#91; Finn leaps in the air , but gets knocked away and lands on top of the chandelier . &#93;
Georgy : Aw , come on .
Will you knock it off already ?
Wendy : You know you &apos;re not even real vampires .
Finn : Pssh .

&#91; realizes &#93; Oh .
&#91; The chandelier breaks loose .
<unk> falls screaming to the floor . &#93;
Yo , man .

Jake : Yeah .
&#91; The ghosts &apos; mouths start to close in on our heroes when Marceline suddenly appears out of nowhere . &#93;
Marceline : VAMPIRE KICK ! ! !
&#91; She kicks the ghosts &apos; mouths away . &#93;
Finn .
Jake .
I &apos;m so sorry I got you into this .

Marceline : Oh , no , vampires can &apos;t beat ghosts .
It &apos;s sort of a <unk> thing .
I just came to apologize .
Finn : Aw , man .
&#91; The ghosts &apos; mouths pick up Jake and Finn and start sucking on their heads . &#93;
I can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature .
&#91; Suddenly , the ghosts drop Finn . &#93;
Georgy : Uh ... did you guys say ... Heat Signature ?
&#91; The scene cuts to a <unk> from the movie Heat Signature .
A Commander and Private are inside a <unk> , looking at a <unk> . &#93;

&#91; The scene <unk> back to Marceline &apos;s living room .
Marceline and the ghosts are watching in awe while Finn and Jake <unk> about on the uncomfortable furniture , looking none too <unk> . &#93;
Finn : &#91; groans in frustration &#93; This <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
Could we just go back to the <unk> or whatever ?
Georgy : <unk> .

Billy : Ahh , that &apos;d be a waste of time .
Jake : Heh .

Ah ... ah ... Finn : What do you mean , &quot; pointless ? &quot;

The cobbler strikes himself with a <unk> , and it has no effect .
The cobbler panics . &#93;
Jake : Dude ... how much of that potion did you use ?
&#91; Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles .
The townspeople have grown armor as well .
One of the townspeople &apos;s belly button starts shooting flames . &#93;

Ice King is heard screaming .
The scene changes to inside Ice King &apos;s home . &#93;
Ice King : This is so <unk> !
They &apos;re the ones who should be grounded .
Not me !
&#91; Ice King shakes his head quickly . &#93;
I &apos;m so mad !
I could just hit them !
If only I could hit them without leaving the castle .
&#91; Ice King taps his crown while closing his eyes in concentration .
He gets an idea and goes over to his computer .
He starts typing . &#93;
&#91; reading what he &apos;s typing : &#93; H ... I ... <unk> ... M ... A ... <unk>
&#91; in his own thoughts : &#93; Ooh !

<unk> &#93; Ice King : Perfect .
&#91; reading what he &apos;s typing &#93; <unk> Mr. Scorcher , I would like you to hit two people .
Neat name by the way .

&#91; Ice King types out <unk> 3 to <unk> a heart when he says love . &#93;
&#91; The Scorcher appears behind Ice King right after he sent the <unk> .
Ice King screams in surprise . &#93;
Ice King : Whoa , you are fast .
&#91; The Scorcher looks at him and says nothing . &#93;
And quiet .
&#91; The Scorcher continues to look at him quietly . &#93;
And very good at <unk> silence .
I like it .
&#91; Ice King gets up from his chair by the computer . &#93;
Alright , so , how do we do this ?
We shake hands or ... &#91; The Scorcher &apos;s hand lights on fire and Ice King screams in fright .
The Scorcher produces a contract from the fires .
He hands it to Ice King . &#93;
Oh-ho , paperwork !
&#91; The contract reads : Who shall I hit ? &#93;
&#91; reading off what he &apos;s writing : &#93; Finn and Jake .
&#91; The contract is lit on fire and disappears .
The Scorcher emits a black vapor and <unk> , taking the vapor with him .
Ice King starts laughing .
He flies over to his telescope . &#93;
Whoosh !

He sees Finn and Jake inside .
He also sees the Scorcher outside , looking at them . &#93;

&#91; The Scorcher lights their Tree Fort on fire .
The Scorcher then disappears while a fire rages . &#93;
What the — ? !

&#91; Ice King flies out of his castle . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to inside of the Tree Fort .
We can see fires <unk> outside while Finn and Jake are making sandwiches . &#93;
Jake : Dude , you see my <unk> coming together , right ?

Jake : That &apos;s Meat Man &apos;s meat .
Finn : Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat ?
Jake : I don &apos;t know .

&#91; Jake is about to take a bite of his sandwich , when Ice King breaks through their wall , spitting ice everywhere , <unk> Finn and Jake &apos;s tree house .
Jake &apos;s sandwich gets frozen in a block of ice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; yells : &#93; No !

Jake : It &apos;s wasted , man .
Finn : Oh , great .

So help me , Ice King .
Ice King : Okay , okay .

&#91; Scene switches to Ice King flying to his castle . &#93;
Ice King : Sheesh , this Scorcher guy &apos;s got some weird <unk> about hitting .
&#91; Ice King arrives at his house .
The Scorcher hands him a piece of paper . &#93;
Ice King : Hey , there you are !
What &apos;s that ?

&#91; Ice King slaps the paper away . &#93;
I thought I told you to hit them , not burn them alive !
You big dummy !
Goll !
It &apos;s almost like you want to kill them !
Lucky for them , I stopped the fire !
&#91; The Scorcher &apos;s eyes glow brighter .
He runs out while Ice King <unk> on . &#93;

He turns into a black vapor and covers everything in the room .
He goes inside Finn &apos;s and Jake &apos;s bodies through their open mouths .
&#91; Scene shows Ice King looking through the window .
He gasps and breaks the window open .

&#91; Scene changes back to the Ice King &apos;s castle .
The Scorcher is waiting for the Ice King there . &#93;
Ice King : Okay , <unk> , you are really trying my patience .

&#91; Ice King shows the Scorcher by punching him on the shoulder . &#93;
Are you even <unk> ?
Oh , I get it .
&#91; Ice King pulls out a wad of <unk> <unk> . &#93;
Here &apos;s <unk> the <unk> to not kill Finn and Jake .

Ice King : Okay , I hired a guy to kill you by <unk> .
Finn and Jake : What ? !
Ice King : I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch .
&#91; Finn and Jake <unk> at him , <unk> . &#93;
Well , I <unk> him in ice , but I think he &apos;s free now &apos; cause he &apos;s made out of fire .
Or he <unk> fire , maybe ?
Jake : Good job .
Good job , the Ice King .
&#91; The Scorcher breaks into the Tree Fort in a cloud of black vapor . &#93;
Finn : Oh , my life !
&#91; The Scorcher throws a fire ball at Jake , who ducks it .
The fire burns a hole in the wall .
Jake throws his coffee in the Scorcher &apos;s face . &#93;
Jake : C &apos;mon , man , let &apos;s get outta here !
&#91; Scene switches to outside of the Tree Fort .
Jake grows big to run quickly away with Finn on his back , and Ice King flies away .
The Scorcher gets up , turns into a black vapor , and follows them . &#93;
Finn : Jake , do something .
He &apos;s getting close !
&#91; Jake stretches out a foot to hit the Scorcher .
He misses .
The Scorcher squints as he summons a giant fire ball .
Jake , in his <unk> , trips over a tree stump .
Finn and Jake fall to the ground and look up to see the fire ball <unk> towards them .
They hug each other and don &apos;t look .
Before the fire ball can reach them , Ice King builds a barrier out of ice to protect himself and them . &#93;
Ice King : You alive ?
Jake : Uh , I think so .
Ice King : Whew !
That was close .
&#91; Suddenly , the ice barrier starts shaking .
The Scorcher is shown throwing fire balls at the barrier .
Water drips on Jake &apos;s head . &#93;
Jake : Uh , hey , guys ?
I don &apos;t think this ice dome is gonna last long .
Finn : What do we do ?
Ice King : &#91; Ice King closes his eyes in concentration .
He gets an idea . &#93;
Ooh , got it !
I &apos;m gonna kill you guys !
Jake : Hey , I &apos;ll kill you !
Ice King : No , wait a minute , you two .
I won &apos;t actually kill you .
I &apos;m just gonna lower your body <unk> so you seem dead .
And after we fool that fool outside , I &apos;ll warm you up , good as new .
Jake : No way , man !
&#91; Jake turns his back to the Ice King . &#93;
You already messed up enough stuff .
You &apos;re probably gonna kill us , too .
Finn : Yeah , we don &apos;t trust you !
&#91; Ice King zaps them anyway , <unk> them in ice <unk> . &#93;
Ice King : You &apos;ll thank me later .
&#91; Scene switches to outside .
Ice King breaks open the dome . &#93;
Ice King : &#91; to the Scorcher : &#93; Stop !
Time out !
You don &apos;t need to do this anymore !
Look !
They &apos;re dead !
I killed them myself !
&#91; Ice King starts hitting Finn &apos;s ice chunk . &#93;
Dead , dead , dead , dead , dead , dead !
They &apos;re dead .
No <unk> .
&#91; The Scorcher squints .
He melts Finn &apos;s ice chunk to feel his <unk> on his arm .
The Scorcher nods . &#93;
Ice King : So , uh , looks like , you can go home now .
&#91; The Scorcher produces a contract from a fire .
Ice King yells until he realizes what it is . &#93;
Ice King : Oh , yes , of course .
&#91; He signs the contract . &#93;
There .
&#91; The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor .
He leaves a paper that reads : <unk> of past <unk> <unk> the <unk> on my present course I await its reflection in the future .
Ice King looks at it and throws it away . &#93;
Ice King : Oh , glad all that &apos;s over .
&#91; Ice King gets up on Finn and Jake &apos;s ice <unk> . &#93;
Hey , guys , guess what ?
You &apos;re grounded .
Underneath my butt !
&#91; Ice King laughs . &#93;
&#91; Flame Princess slaps Finn , leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face . &#93;
Flame Princess : Don &apos;t ever mess with me again !
&#91; Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Looks at Jake &#93; Who was that ?
Jake : &#91; Still terrified &#93; The Princess of the Fire Kingdom ?
Finn : &#91; Looks out the window , then back at Jake &#93; Dude , I think I have a crush .
&#91; Finn walks in front of Jake . &#93;
Finn : What do you know about her , Jake ?
Jake : I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by <unk> you two up .

Finn : Is that bird ... smoking ?

&#91; In desperation &#93; Wait , listen !
Ice King : &#91; <unk> Omnichord up &#93; Yeah , let &apos;s go !
What &apos;s it say ?

&#91; Marceline reads the message again , then stares at Ice King , not sure what to do . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Singing and reading note &#93; &quot; Marceline , is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world ?
That must be so confusing for a little girl .
And I know you &apos;re going to need me here with you ... but I &apos;m losing myself , and I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to lose me , too ... &quot; Ice King : Ooh , yeah !
Keep it going !
&#91; Goes to drumset &#93; Marceline : &#91; Looking for another photo &#93; Oh !

Please forgive me for whatever I do &#91; Marceline shrinks in <unk> &#93; ... when I don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
Ice King : &#91; Happy &#93; Wow !

Hot stuff !
Marceline : What ? !
You don &apos;t remember what it means ? !
&#91; She grabs another photo and shows it to him .
She tears up as her voice breaks . &#93;
Look !
Ice King : &#91; <unk> note while singing &#93; &quot; Marceline , I can feel myself slipping away .
I can &apos;t remember what it made me say ... but I remember that I saw you frown .
I swear , it wasn &apos;t me .
It was the crown .
&#91; He frowns and looks confused , but then ignores it . &#93;
This magic keeps me — &quot; Ice King &amp; Marceline : &#91; Singing together &#93; &quot; — alive , but it &apos;s making me crazy , &#91; Marceline begins shedding tears . &#93;
and I want to save you , but who &apos;s going to save me ? !
Please forgive me for ... &quot; &#91; Finn and Jake are still in the cave .
Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars . &#93;
Jake : What is goin &apos; on in there ? !
Finn : &#91; Takes binoculars off &#93; ... I have no idea .
Ice King &amp; Marceline : &#91; Singing together &#93; &quot; ... Please forgive me for whatever I do ... when I don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
&#91; As the music continues &#91; and Ice King and Marceline sing , &quot; <unk> da ... da da ... da da ... &quot; &#93; , the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse .
It looks <unk> and there are ruined <unk> everywhere .
A child Marceline cries .
Simon <unk> returns to her and <unk> her tears in <unk> for leaving her alone .
He walks to a ruined store and grabs a teddy bear .
He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further <unk> , and she smiles <unk> .
The episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode starts when Finn and Jake were helping Flame Princess &apos;s target practice . &#93;
Jake : Ready ?
