[Finn and Jake are sitting atop a cliff made from a decrepit skyscraper overlooking a body of water]
Finn: Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who’s like your opposite?
Jake: I don’t know. I’m the "first come first serve" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can’t last forever! [chuckles] [Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass, unnoticed by Finn and Jake] I didn’t mean that. Don’t spread that around.
Finn: So it’s not good to weigh someone’s qualities against your own?
Jake: Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something! [Jake’s head turns into a graph and his hand an upward moving arrow] It’s not about personality matrixals and charts, it’s all about the bu-bumps in your heart! [His head is a heart shape that beats every time he say “bumps” or “pumps”. He gets extremely close to Finn and his eyes are bugging out] You can’t stop the pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! [Finn chuckles, as does Magic Man]
Finn: Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King?
Jake: What about them? [Looks confused]
Finn: Would they make a good couple?
Jake: Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you?
Finn: No no!
Jake: Oh, I see. You’re being weird.
[Magic man reaches down into his hole and pulls out a bag]
Finn: It’s not that weird! Come on!
Magic Man [quietly]: Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law.
Jake: BMO and Ice King?
[Magic man puts the bag on the outside of Finn’s pants]
Finn: Yeah!
Magic Man [quietly]: I’m not coming back. [Retreats into his hole]
Jake: You’re creepin’ me out. [Gets up]
Finn: I’m just thinkin’ out loud. [Jake starts walking away and Finn bends forward so he can see Jake between his legs] What, can’t think out loud?
[Finn is walking back home with Jake]
Jake: Oh, is that what you’re doing?
Finn: Yeah man! Pffft, jeez don’t be judgy.
Jake: I’m not!
Finn: Yeah, you are!
Jake: How could you know that?
Finn: I can hear it in your tone.
Jake: You can? [in a mocking tone]
Finn: Yeah, wise-guy.
Jake: [Pointing to the bag] Hey, what’s that in your pants?
Finn: [Looking at the back of his pants] What?! Not again! [Finn sees the bag on the other side] Oh. I don’t know. [Finn grabs the bag] Whoa, look.
Jake: Crazy. [Finn opens the bag and reaches in] Careful, dude.
Finn: What the--? [Finn pulls out his hand with Princess Bubblegum, Lumpy Space Princess, BMO, Jake, and himself]
Jake: What the heck?! Are they alive?! [They are now moving around aimlessly]
Finn: Hey, are you guys alive? [BMO starts to fall off, but Jake catches him] I don’t know, man, I think they’re some kind of magic toy.
Jake: Maybe it’s black magic. Maybe we shouldn’t mess with them.
Finn: No, man, look! That’s you! [Jake is playing the viola with Lumpy Space Princess on his back and Finn and BMO are dancing to the music] You’re totally shedding on the viola.
Jake: Yeah, that’s good. How many more thingies are in there?
Finn: [Looks in the bag] Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Let’s check this out at the house. [They run towards the house]
Jake: I’ll make a special spagot [spaghetti] with a new sauce.
[Finn is at the table while Jake is cooking the spaghetti. He dumps out some of the little people onto the table]
Finn: Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady. [Picks up Princess Bubblegum and moves her towards Lady] C-listers, go back in the bag. [Pushes Xergiok, Donny, Tiffany, Lemongrab, one of the Gumdrop lasses, and'Turtle Princess]
Jake: [stirring the noodles] Who’s in the C-list? [Adds something, possibly wine, from a bottle, then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate]
Finn: Tiffany, Donny. [To himself] Well, he’s okay. [Out loud] Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys!
Jake: That’s not very nice. [Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table]
Finn: Don’t worry, man. They’ll get involved eventually.
Jake: Involved with what? [Sits down and gives Finn his food]
Finn: I don’t know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum!
Jake: [Stretches to get forks. Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation. It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions] What are they talkin’ about?
Finn: It’s hard to say, but I think it’s got something to do with Lady being preggos [pregnant].
Jake: Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!
Finn: That’s your narrative, buddy.
Jake: Alright, well, what else ya got goin’ on?
Finn: Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here. [Points to Ice King]
Jake: Ice King? He’s not C-list?
Finn: [Looking through the bag to find Ice King's drum kit] Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go. [Puts it in front of Ice King] Okay, jam out, little Ice King. [Ice King starts playing]
Jake: [Little Jake sees the Ice King playing and runs over to him to join in] No. Don’t play with that hack. Aww, man. Hmm. [Jake looks surprised] They’ve got good chemistry. Who’d have guessed?
Finn: Chemistry...
[Finn looks as though he just had a good idea. He looks at several groups of toy people. Ice King and Jake playing together. Marceline and Hunson Abadeer in the background with Finn stealing Lemongrab’s Lemon Camel in the foreground. Mr. Cupcake exercising. Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess playing cards]
Jake: Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold. [Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess] I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay?
Finn: Yeees.
[Later on, Finn is now awake, but in bed with Jake fast asleep. Finn looks over at Jake to make sure he’s asleep. Confident that he’s asleep, he grabs the bag from under his pillow and retreats into his sleeping bag. He takes the lens off a flashlight and puts it in front of him. Then he takes Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess out. Mr. Cupcake starts flexing and Lumpy Space Princess is impressed. Finn chuckles. Lumpy Space Princess looks enamored and begins working her lumps. Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess start kissing]
Finn: Whoooooa.
[Finn looks curious and takes away Lumpy Space Princess. Mr. Cupcake looks surprised. Finn looks and the bag and then mixes it. Finn grabs Lady and then checks to make sure Jake is still asleep. He then puts Lady next to Mr. Cupcake. Mr. Cupcake starts flexing, but Lady ignores him and grazes a piece of Finn’s sleeping bag. When he sees nothing is happening, he pushes Lady into Mr. Cupcakes arms. Mr. Cupcake wiggles his eyebrows and Lady laughs.]
[Finn then grabs Jake and contemplates what he’s about to do. He looks a bit concerned. Lady and Mr. Cupcake are kissing and Finn puts Jake right in front of them. Jake doesn’t notice, but Finn moves his head around to see them. Then Jake starts yelling “wah”. Mr. Cupcake drops Lady and she acts with indignation towards Jake. Jake argues back and then Mr. Cupcake starts yelling at Jake. Jake pushes him and Lady pleads that they not fight. Finn looks towards the bag and then looks back with realization. He empties out the bag. The scene ends.]
Jake: [Jake wakes up and heads down stairs. Finn is sitting at the dinner table with a multitude of Jay T. Doggzone books arranged into a little town] You’re up early.
Finn: I didn’t sleep. [Very blunt and tired]
Jake: [Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug] You stay up all night readin’ trash books? [Finn makes a weak “meh” sound.] I told you, man. Those datin’ books. [Sips drink] That stuff is mess you up. [Drinks again]
Finn: I’m not reading. I’m playing with the little wees.
Jake: Oh, let me see little me. [Stretches his head to find little Jake is sitting by himself next to an open book] Me look so lonely. Hey, Finn, pass me little Lady.
Finn: Uh, you guys broke up.
Jake: [Confused] Wha?
Finn: She’s with someone else now.
Jake: [Angry] Who?!
Finn: He’s a cool guy, don’t worry about it.
Jake: [Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source. He finds little Finn in Lady’s lap kissing under a book teepee] Ahhhhhh! [Slams his fists on the table] What the ball, man?!
Finn: [Laughs and shrugs; he doesn’t sound as worn out as before] What?
Jake: What? What do ya think “what”?!
Finn: Come on, they’re not real, they’re like toys. These guys here, they’re goin’ out. [Points the Marceline and Peppermint Butler in a tea cup. Marceline licks the red off of Peppermint Butler’s side.] Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. They’re still testing the waters. [Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl are dancing and are joined by Abracadaniel] But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P. [Turtle Princess is seen lightly spanking Xergiok. Finn laughs.] Weird. But cool. Right, Jake?
Jake: [slowly backs towards the exit] I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. [Leaves]
Finn: Okay. Whatever whatevs. [Goes over to little Finn and Lady and chuckles] Weird. [Grabs little Finn and Flame Princess] Huh?
[Finn puts both of them near each other, but nothing happens. Finn breaks off part of a cookie and puts in on little Finn’s head. He grabs it and Flame Princess yawns. Finn uses a pencil to move little Finn’s legs to walk towards Flame Princess. Flame Princess is pleasantly surprised to see little Finn and giggles. Little Finn breaks part of the cookie crumb off and gives it to Flame Princess. They then start to eat each end of what’s left. Lady comes out of her teepee to see little Finn and Flame Princess and starts crying hysterically and runs back to the book house]
[Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn. At first they awkwardly stand around, but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum’s hand onto little Finn’s shoulder. She begins massaging his shoulders and he likes it. Real Finn looks around nervously to make sure no one can see what he’s doing. Then they kiss and Flame Princess is outraged. She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back. Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation, but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum’s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady’s teepee. Using Lady as a kind of hose, the water being her tears, Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess. They begin fighting and real Finn is astonished and begins blushing.]
[A card that reads "16 WEEKS LATER" comes up.]
Jake: I’m back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did. [The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful] Yeesh. You okay, man?
Finn: I don’t know.
[Little Finn is standing on top of a book staring into the distance]
Jake: What’s little Finn doing?
Finn: He’s... thinking.
Jake: [Looks concerned] He looks sad. What’s he thinking about?
Finn: I don’t know. Probably lots of stuff.
Jake: Where’s little Rainicorn?
Finn: Probably still crying.
Jake: Wha?
Finn: She’s not handling the break-up very well.
Jake: [sees Lady still crying in her teepee] Aww.
Finn: PB's good, though. [Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned. She looks very angry.] After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she’s really into it.
Jake: This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.
Finn: [Looks perturbed] I know!
Jake: [Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler] The destruction! [Xergiok looks like he’s in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him] The depravity! [Choose Goose, Abracadaniel, and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together] The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. [Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms.]
Finn: No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I’m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
Jake: You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man!
Finn: I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
Jake: How would ya do that?
Finn: [Lets go of his arms and Jake steps back] I’m gonna talk to him.
Jake: But he can’t hear you.
Finn: Yeah, why is that?
Jake: Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us.
Finn: [Gets really close to little Finn] Lemme try this. Finn! Can you hear me? [Sticks his tongue out while talking and pokes little Finn a few times] We’re connected! FINN!
[Little Finn is shown standing as the same cliff shown in the beginning of the episode and talks as though he’s depressed]
Jake: Try shakin’ him.
Finn: Why?
Jake: Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds.
Finn: [Grabs him and starts shaking] Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn!
Jake: Now go faster!
Finn: FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN!
[In the Little People's world, some clouds begin to form a crude Finn head.]
Jake: Faster!
Finn: [The cloud Finn says this in the Little People's world] FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN! [The clouds dissipate and little Finn looks surprised]
Jake: Go slower, he saw you!
Finn: Okay. [In the Little People’s world] Fiiiinn. Can you hear me?
Little Finn: Wah wah wah.
Jake: Whoa! Neat!
Finn: I made you do those crummy things. I’m why yous guys is fighting. I’m the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again. [Little Finn asks a question] Don’t worry I will take care of it. [The clouds dissipate and then reassemble] Sorry, my arm got tired. [Little Finn is confused by this.] Never mind. It’ll be fine. Goodbye, little Finn! I’m not coming back!
Jake: Now what?
Finn: [shaking Lady, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess at the same time and they all see the cloud] Hey, ladies! This is big Finn! I caused all the problems! It wasn’t anyone’s fault! Don’t be mad at each other! Have a… dance party! Okay, goodbye! I’m not coming back! [Finn pulls a stereo out of the bag and starts the music. The three of them begin dancing and with the others.]
Jake: Is that gonna do it? [The little people join the party and start dancing] Get the C-listers out. [They begin dancing as well] Good party. Oh, flip! [BMO and the Ice King are dancing] Look who’s hittin’ it off with the Ice King! [Chuckles]
[Princess Bubblegum is in her lab working on a circuit board when a cloaked bird drops a letter on her table and flies away.]
Princess Bubblegum: What the... [she breaks the seal on the letter and reads it aloud] "mmmmn Princess Bubblegum, we are starving, immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you, ours, Lemon Grabs." [stops reading] Bull gunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy!
[She swivels her chair to the window and looks out at Jake and Cinnamon Bun having a picnic, with Finn watching in the bushes.]
Princess Bubblegum: Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!
Finn: Okay!
Jake: [getting up] Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.
[Scene changes to inside Princess Bubblegum's lab. Princess Bubblegum is loading small, colorful spheres into a case.]
Finn: [entering room] Hey, Preebs.
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them. [gestures to case] This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food. [closes case] So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. [hands case to Jake]
Finn: For sure. We'll do it.
Princess Bubblegum: [saluting] Good luck, gentlemen!
[Finn jumps on Jake who jumps out the window and stretches his ears into wings.]
Cinnamon Bun: [waving] Bye, girlfriend! [laughs]
[Finn and Jake make their way to Castle Lemongrab and open the gate.]
Jake: Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?
Finn: Holy--!
[They see various Lemon creatures, who start advancing toward them and touching them.]
Finn: [worried] Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Jake: [smacking a Lemon spider off his arm] Kiss it!
[Finn and Jake start backing away from the creatures through the courtyard.]
Finn: Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food! [Lemon goat bites Finn's hand] Hey!
Jake: Hey! Weirdos! [stretches his hand into a slice of cake] Get the birthday cake!
[Jake pretends to throw it, and the Lemon people run over to where they think it landed. Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up and go through another gate. On the opposite wall is a giant Lemon creature's face.]
Lemonjon: Are you lemon?
Finn and Jake: Whoa!
Jake: What the thing is up with this guy?
Lemonjon: Does your head come to a nub?
Jake: What?
Lemonjon: You are un-lemon.
Finn: Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?
Lemonjon: I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!
Finn: Wait, what?
Lemonjon: They're quite hungry.
Finn: Yeah. What the heck's going on here?
Lemonjon: There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!
Finn: Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.
Jake: Where should we go?
Lemonjon: Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon.
Jake: I wonder who put them in there.
Finn: I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?
[Lemonjon picks up a rock with his lips and throws it at the wall, making a hole.]
Jake: Oh, cool!
Finn: [running to hole] Thanks, man!
Jake: [going through hole] Yeah, thanks, man!
[Finn and Jake make their way down a poorly lit corridor. Something skitters across the screen behind them.]
Jake: [turns around] Hmmm.
[A brick in the ceiling falls down and shatters. Jake clears his throat and he and Finn walk along the wall past it. Finn opens a door and looks inside. He sees a gigantic heart that isn't pumping and a large pipe dumping yellow liquid through a grate. Finn closes the door.]
Jake: Hmmm.
[They continue down some stairs and come to a door.]
Finn: [opening door] Yo, Lemon-wipes!
[Past the door are more gigantic organs, swelling and wriggling.]
Jake: Yech.
[They close the door and walk down a different hallway.]
Jake: Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.
Finn: [taking Jake's hand] Yeah, sure!
Jake: So, where'd you want to look ne--[looks at what he's holding, which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand.] Eeeh! [yanks hand away] Uh, Finn?!
Finn: [down the hall] Oh, sorry dude.
[Creature runs away and Jake catches up to Finn, who is by a door.]
Finn: [opening door] Stay close to me.
[Inside is a giant pair of kidneys and a small Lemon creature, wailing loudly. It turns to them and its face peels.]
Jake: [closes door] Nope!
[Jake hurriedly picks up Finn and kicks open an air duct. He throws Finn inside and follows him in. They fall out the other end into another hallway, at the end of which is a door with bars.]
Jake: [running to door] I think this is it.
Finn: [ratting handle] All locked up! [looks through bars] There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!
Lemongrab: Go away.
Lemongrab 2: No food here.
Jake: Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.
Finn: Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.
Jake: Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse! [makes fist huge] Let's just get this over with. [punches down door]
Finn: Lemongrabs, you're free!
Lemongrab: They broke the door! The door is broken now!
Lemongrab 2: FIX THE DOOR!
Jake: Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door.
Lemongrab: It doesn't matter anymore.
Lemongrab 2: There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs.
Lemongrabs: [Half screaming, half singing] NO CRUMBS!
Finn: Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?
Jake: You know there's guys starvin' up there?!
Lemongrab: Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them...
Lemongrab 2: ...for whom they starve.
Lemongrab: Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!
Finn: Wha--?
Lemongrab: You see, Finn, [starts pacing] when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab...
Lemongrab 2: ...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab...
Lemongrab: [holds up formula]...she left behind a little something-something: the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family.
Lemongrab 2: Yes, yes! All her fault!
Lemongrab: What? What'd you say?
Lemongrab 2: I said, "all her fault."
Lemongrab: Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist?
Lemongrab 2: I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs.
Lemongrab: Me, too.
Lemongrab 2: It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face...
Lemongrab: ...and hearing each new piercing song!
Plop-Top: [screams]
Lemongrab 2: We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here.
Lemongrab: Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome.
Lemongrab 2: [screams] Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!
Finn: Look. We brought these seeds. [opens case] They're special candy seeds.
Jake: You can grow new food now.
Lemongrab: [walks over] Oh, yes. [taking seeds] Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes. [pushes Plop-Top off of table, squishes seeds together]
Lemongrab 2: Yes, yes. There we go! [pours formula onto wad]
[Wad of seeds comes to life and immediately throws up the excess formula.]
Lemongrab: Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad!
Lemongrab 2: [admiringly] Ooh!
Jake: You really are gonna die.
Finn: ...and all your boys, too!
Lemongrab: Our... boys?
Finn: Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!
Lemongrab: Yes. Okay.
Lemongrab 2: For our boys.
Lemongrab: But first we will notify the children of our impending departure...
Lemongrabs: ...so they won't worry about us while we're away.
[Scene changes to room with Lemonjon, where all the Lemon people have gathered.]
Lemongrab: Okay, yes. The hard times are over!
[Lemon people cheer.]
Lemongrab 2: Mmmm, here's the plan...
Lemongrab: We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!
Lemongrab 2: Now go, young Lemonjon!
Lemongrab: Go! Go!
[Lemongrabs chant 'go' while Lemonjon begins standing up. The castle shakes and pieces of the ceiling start raining down.]
Finn: What's going on, Lemongrabs?!
Lemongrab: It's all [points finger at Finn] your fault!
Lemongrab 2: [points finger at Finn] All your fault!
Lemongrab: We warned you!
Lemongrab 2: We warned you about us!
[Finn and Jake run out of the room. Lemonjon stands up, tipping Finn and Jake out of the castle. Finn grabs on to the ledge and Jake grabs Finn's other hand.]
Finn: Yaaaah! [pants, looks down at Lemonjon's leg] What the--?
Finn and Jake: [as Lemonjon starts walking] Whoaaaaaa!
Finn: Jake! Are you alright?
Jake: Yeah, but look! [points] He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!
Finn: [gasps] And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...
Jake: Giant poison candy aspirin! [holds up large pill] I've got this one, but it might be too small.
Finn: No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.
Jake: Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there [points] with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?
Finn: Oh yeah, that's probably it. [Jake stretches them over to the grate] Whoaaa! [Finn opens grate and climbs in, retches as liquid drenches him] Oh, man!
Jake: [climbing in] Tastes like vitamins.
Finn: [grunting and punching the heart]
Jake: Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.
Finn: Just smash it already, grandma.
Jake: Right. [grows hands and hits the heart hard]
[Heart starts pumping. Finn and Jake are thrown across the room.]
Finn: [sarcastically] Oh, nice one, Jake.
Lemonjon: [stops walking] Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source? [groans] The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only: that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!
[Lemonjon strains and dissolves into millions of small, lemon-shaped candies. Finn, Jake, and the Lemon people fall to the ground.]
Finn: Whoa, dang! [picks up some candies] That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.
[Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum's lab, where she is using a pencil to erase some words from the Lemongrabs' exposed brains.]
Princess Bubblegum: [erasing] ...and... there... we... go. [blows on Lemongrab's brain] All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!
Finn: ...and I snatched this [holds up formula] out of the Lemon castle, boyee!
Princess Bubblegum: Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble.
Jake: But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this.
Lemongrabs: [smiling] Hmm!
[The episode opens in the Tree House. Finn is eating cereal and Jake is sipping coffee.]
Finn: [Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.]
Jake: [Slurps]
Finn: Huh?
Jake: I was just sipping my coffee.
Finn: Oh. [Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.]
Jake: [Slurps]
Finn: [Munching]
Jake: [Slurp]
Finn: [Munching]
Jake: [Slurp]
[Both of them notice the pattern and begin repeating it rhythmically. On the third repeat, Finn only munches his cereal once, tricking Jake into sipping early and breaking the pattern. They both laugh. BMO joins them.]
BMO: I am also excited about today.
Jake: Oh, yeah?
BMO: Today is the first day of my new job.
Finn: What's your new job, BMO?
Jake: Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat?
BMO: I'm a door-to-door salesman.
Finn and Jake: [Together] Oh.
Jake: What are you selling?
BMO: I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint.
Jake: I'll take it! [He takes the lint.]
BMO: Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons.
Jake: Can I pay you later?
BMO: Mm, the customer is always right!
Jake: Good attitude, BMO.
BMO: Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood.
[BMO stands up clumsily, revealing that someone else is inside the overcoat and BMO is sitting on their head, pretending they are his own body. "BMO" almost knocks a glass off the table, but Finn catches it. He notices Ice King's robes and feet sticking out the bottom of the overcoat.]
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] It's Ice King.
Jake: [Whispering back] I know.
Ice King: [Peeks his face out the front of the overcoat and spots that Finn and Jake have seen him.] Oh! [He quickly closes the overcoat.]
BMO: [Exiting] Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need-
[Ice King falls down the ladder, interrupting BMO. They both scream as they fall. There is a thud. Finn and Jake giggle at their shenanigans.]
Finn and Jake: [Together] Aww.
[BMO and Ice King leave the Tree House.]
Ice King: Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door.
BMO: Bodies don't talk, Ice King.
Ice King: Well, mine does.
BMO: Okay, then. If I say "My feet hurt," you can go "Woof woof." That's my dogs barking.
Ice King: BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team.
BMO: Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! [Kicking the sides of Ice King's head and laughing.]
[A sword logo flies onto screen reading "Potential customer time!" The scene changes to Tree Trunks' house.]
Tree Trunks: [Reading as she types on a typewriter] "Chapter 3: No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door."
[Suddenly, there is a knock at the door.]
Tree Trunks: Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all. [She opens the door, finding BMO and Ice King.] Hello.
BMO: Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather? [After some fumbling, Ice King tips BMO's hat politely.]
Tree Trunks: So polite. Please, please come in.
BMO: [Taking a seat] You have a lovely home.
Tree Trunks: Here, have some apple pie.
BMO: Oh, thank you.
[Ice King snatches the apple pie and takes it inside the overcoat.]
Tree Trunks: Now what can I do for you?
BMO: Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today.
[He grunts and kicks Ice King, who is busy eating the pie inside the coat. Ice King puts his arms back into the sleeves and rummages through his and BMO's bag.]
BMO: Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint.
Tree Trunks: Another?
BMO: These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top.
[While BMO is presenting the items, Ice King struggles to eat more of the apple pie with his tongue.]
Tree Trunks: I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself.
[Ice King makes his way to the shelf with the jar, stubbing his toe and smashing several plates on the way. He reaches into the jar and pulls out a huge roll of banknotes.]
BMO: [Laughs happily as Ice King tosses the money wad from hand to hand. Tree Trunks joins the laughter, not really paying attention as she has been distracted by the branch.] You have a lovely home! [Ice King falls out the door and they both scream as they exit.]
Mr. Pig: [Entering] What'd you buy, honey bunch?
Tree Trunks: A branch.
Mr. Pig: Huh. [Tree Trunks turns him around and starts scratching his back with the branch.] Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius.
BMO: [Laughing as he and Ice King leave the orchard.] I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun.
Ice King: Why?
BMO: Because I think I see our next customer. [They watch a large chipmunk carrying a couple of acorns.] Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy!
[The chipmunk begins running, and Ice King begins chasing.]
BMO: How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again. [Laughs] Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything.
[They come to a stop.]
Ice King: BMO, where's the customer?
BMO: Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost.
[An animal howls. The scene fades to later. BMO and Ice King have arrived at a ziggurat.]
BMO: Look. A house.
Ice King: All I see is the inside of this coat.
[They approach a door.]
BMO: And... stop. Knock politely.
[Ice King knocks, and footsteps are heard inside. A mysterious figure answers the door and beckons them inside.]
BMO: Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home. [Whispering to Ice King] Turn. [Continues talking to the mysterious figure] How are your children? [BMO gasps, noticing that the figure has disappeared.]
[Ice King wanders further into the zigurrat, where he finds Uncle Gumbald mixing liquids in a pair of test tubes.]
BMO: Hello.
[One of the tubes produces a skull-shaped puff of smoke which floats towards BMO and Ice King. Gumbald retrieves an axe from beneath his desk.]
BMO: I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am.
[The smoke enters the coat and Ice King is heard choking.]
BMO: [Chuckling] Oh, excuse my indigestion. [He kicks Ice King.]
Ice King: Ouch.
BMO: I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag.
[Gumbald raises the axe menacingly.]
BMO: Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth?
[Gumbald drops the axe to the ground and suddenly adopts a polite manner.]
Gumbald: Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable.
[The scene changes. BMO, Ice King, and Gumbald are sat in the parlor while Gumbald examines the teeth.]
Gumbald: And you're sure these are Finn's teeth?
BMO: Yes.
Gumbald: The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts?
BMO: Yes.
Gumbald: Finn the Human's teeth?
BMO: That's a BMO guarantee.
Ice King: [Whispering] Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
BMO: [Interrupting] Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here.
Gumbald: I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately. [Admiring the teeth] Yes, my pretties.
[The scene changes back to the Tree House. It is night.]
Jake: Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.
Finn: He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
[Finn and Jake have prepared an "employee of the month" poster for BMO, and set out some cupcakes on the table.]
Jake: Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at.
[The door is heard. BMO and Ice King enter.]
BMO: Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. [Ice King hands Finn a silver goblet.]
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] It's real.
Jake: What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet?
BMO: Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth.
Finn: Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth? [Suddenly realizing] Human baby teeth!! [He rushes up to the bedroom and retrieves a box from a drawer. It's empty.] BMO!
BMO: Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake.
[Finn shows BMO the empty box accusatively.]
BMO: Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you.
Finn: These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid.
Jake: Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, "Why did I buy these things?" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he?
BMO: Well...
[There is a pounding on the door. A load of Baby Teeth Finns break down the door and enter the Tree Fort.]
Finn: [High pitch shriek] Stay back, baby Finns. [Babies begin climbing him, and he and Jake both scream.]
BMO: [Groans nervously]
[A baby starts gnawing on Finn's arm. He punts it with his fist and it shatters a window as it flies through.]
Finn: They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.
Ice King: I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
Jake: Just don't let them climb into your mouth!
[A baby tries to enter Finn's mouth.]
Jake: Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there. [More babies attack Jake.] Where's your baby manners? Eek.
BMO: Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.
Ice King: Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity.
BMO: Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are. [Ice King pulls out a couple of sledgehammers.] Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites.
Finn: [Being gnawed by babies] I'll take one.
Jake: Me too!
BMO: Great decision.
[Ice King hands the hammers to Finn and Jake. Finn taps one of the babies and it disintegrates with a poof. He smashes a few more babies.]
BMO: A little tap is all it takes.
Jake: [Smashing babies] These baby-smashing hammers are great.
[They continue smashing all the babies. Gumbald is seen outside, watching through a telescope. After all the babies are smashed, Finn, Jake, and BMO begin sweeping up the mess.]
BMO: I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.
Ice King: Well, time to call it a day. [He pulls out a clocking-in machine and a punchcard, and clocks out, then places a small hat atop his crown.] The ice man leaveth.
BMO: Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. [They shake hands.]
Ice King: Until tomorrow.
Finn: Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow.
[Ice King exits, whistling. Gumbald watches through his telescope.]
Gumbald: Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth. [Clears throat.]
BMO: One free-range Humpty Dumpty.
BMO: Sorry.
BMO: Fine aged cheddar man.
BMO: Homemade ketchup.
BMO: A fresh pepper fart
BMO: Dance, parsley.
BMO: Face bread.
BMO: Special sentient sandwich.
Jake: Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich?
BMO: Bingo.
BMO: Made by the BMO.
Jake: BMO, you're my little cherub.
Jake: You know that?
Jake: You made all this for me, right?
Jake: Aaahhh.
BMO: Not so fast, Jake!
Jake: Naaaw.
BMO: The sammiches are yours...
BMO: For a price.
Jake: What?
BMO: I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure.
Jake: No way.
Jake: Poo deal.
Jake: I'll do 20 minutes.
BMO: It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake!
BMO: Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line.
Jake: Okay, fine, fine.
Jake: Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse.
BMO: Mm...
BMO: One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum.
Jake: Deal.
BMO: Yippee-ki-yay!
Jake: Om!
Jake: Mm.
Jake: Oh, yeah.
Jake: It tastes alive.
BMO: Steed yourself, partner.
Jake: Okay.
Jake: Om.
Jake: 'Kay.
BMO: Oh, come on, man.
BMO: You didn't even try.
Jake: I did try.
Jake: Horses are hard.
Jake: How's that?
BMO: Eh, it reads.
BMO: Steady, girl.
Jake: Wha...
BMO: Shh, shh, shh.
BMO: I'm going to mount you now.
BMO: Hup!
BMO: Good girl.
Jake: So, what's the plan anyway, BMO?
BMO: The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps!
Jake: Ow.
BMO: Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face.
BMO: Hyah!
Jake: Yow!
BMO: I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder.
BMO: Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch.
Jake: BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly.
Jake: Are you gonna apologize or...
BMO: Horses do not talk.
BMO: Over there! Hyah!
BMO: Whoa!
BMO: Jackrabbit Johnson.
BMO: This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding.
BMO: Makes me sick.
BMO: He was last seen in dead goat gulch.
BMO: What do you say, girl?
BMO: Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?
Jake: You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich.
BMO: Time's a-wasting!
Jake: Hyee!
BMO: Hmm.
Jake: BMO, I'm tired.
BMO: Looks like my horse needs a rest.
BMO: Slow down, horse.
BMO: ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪
BMO: ♪ Is a lonely job ♪
BMO: ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪
BMO: ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪
BMO: ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪
BMO: ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪
BMO: ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪
BMO: ♪ Cowboy ♪
BMO: Be careful, Jake.
BMO: This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low.
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Bang! Bang!
BMO: Put them up, partner!
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Pyew, pyew!
BMO: Pyew, pyew, pyew!
BMO: I want answers!
BMO: [high voice] You can't do this to us!
BMO: No answers, eh?
BMO: No use to me!
BMO: How about you, frisco?
BMO: [high voice] I'm not going to talk.
BMO: Why am I talking to you then?!
BMO: Hooah!
BMO: Yah! Unh!
Neptr: BMO, what did you do?
BMO: It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk.
Neptr: I spent the last three months building all of this.
Jake: Oh, that's where you been?
Neptr: Mm-hmm.
Neptr: BMO gave me a Finn Cake.
BMO: Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed.
Neptr: Aah.
BMO: Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!
BMO: I know you know where he's headed.
Neptr: I don't know!
Neptr: Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know.
Neptr: It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear.
BMO: I don't believe a word you say.
BMO: Now take a message to your compadre.
BMO: Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together.
BMO: Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!
Neptr: Okay.
BMO: Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!
Jake: Neigh!
Me-Mow: Grrr.
BMO: Uhh...
BMO: I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is.
BMO: Better stop for the night.
BMO: We can make a campfire here.
BMO: And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money.
Jake: No.
Jake: It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches.
BMO: But I want to finish the adventure.
Jake: Which direction is the house?
BMO: I'm not sure.
BMO: Get down!
Me-Mow: Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check.
Me-Mow: Capturing my first bounty...
Me-Mow: Check.
Me-Mow: Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge...
Me-Mow: Unchecked.
Finn: Finn and Jake's treehouse?
Me-Mow: Mm-hmm.
Finn: Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?
Me-Mow: I... Am... Me-Mow!
Finn: Me-Mow?! Whoa.
Finn: You've gotten bigger.
Me-Mow: Have we met before?
Jake: Finn, is that you?
BMO: That's Jackrabbit Johnson!
Me-Mow: Finn?
Me-Mow: It is Finn!
Me-Mow: Tricked again!
Jake: Look... It's me-mow, BMO.
BMO: I don't care.
BMO: That's my bounty!
BMO: Yaah!
BMO: Jake, transform...
BMO: Horse!
Jake: Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?
BMO: I am old enough to vote.
Me-Mow: [thinking] Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!
BMO: Your Daisy days are over!
BMO: I am the whaler 'round these parts!
BMO: Huh.
Me-Mow: Sounds like you're out of ammo.
BMO: No, you heard incorrectly.
BMO: Bang, bang, bang!
Me-Mow: I'm coming for you!
Me-Mow: Ugh!
Me-Mow: Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face.
Me-Mow: This prison cell's not going to hold me.
Finn: Oh?
Me-Mow: Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge!
Finn: Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?
BMO: Yes.
Armadillo: Stick 'em up.
Finn: Huh?
BMO: This bounty belongs to me!
BMO: Get out of here!
Armadillo: Yaah!
Finn: Thanks, BMO.
BMO: You're welcome.
[The scene opens to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. A bunch of Clown Nurses are acting around while circus music plays in the background. The head Clown Nurse is sitting by Finn. He is sitting in bed reading the Enchiridion, and his right foot is bandaged.]
Head Clown Nurse: Who wants a cookie? [She moves it around, making airplane sounds.] Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?
Finn: No thanks.
Head Clown Nurse: Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...
Finn: Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
[The camera cuts to Jake. He, too, is sitting in bed, with his right foot bandaged. A big Clown Nurse is standing near him.]
Jake: No way, man.
[Finn groans in disgust.]
Jake: Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake's mouth.] I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides... [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose.] They're funny. [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose again, and she farts this time.] [laughs] Look, she just farted.
Head Clown Nurse: Time for our love therapy.
Finn: Wait, what are they doing? [The Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn's bandaged foot.] Whoa! Stop!
Head Clown Nurse: [gasps] Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?
Finn: NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
Head Clown Nurse: Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo.
Finn: What does that even mean??
Jake: I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.
Big Clown Nurse: You want me to stop?
Jake: No, keep going. [The big Clown Nurse continues smooching Jake's toes.]
Finn: [Beat] You're gross, man. [He notices a page in the Enchiridion.] Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
[The head Clown Nurse takes the book from him.]
Head Clown Nurse: Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! [laughs]
[The Clown Nurses all gather around and start holding Finn down.]
Finn: Huh? Wha?
[The head Clown Nurse gets near Finn's bandaged foot.]
Finn: Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
[The head Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn's bandaged foot.]
Finn: Ahh! Let me go! [The head Clown Nurse is still smooching Finn's foot. He screams and then blacks out. Finn starts having a crazy nightmare about running from Clown Nurses. He trips and sees the head of the head Clown Nurse.]
Head Clown Nurse: It's the only way! [laughs]
[The head rises up and floats in front of him. Finn screams and runs in panic, but ends up falling into the mouth of the Clown Nurse's head.]
Head Clown Nurse: [softly] It's the only way!
[Finn wakes up. The Head Clown Nurse is rapidly smooching Finn's foot. Finn gets up and the Clown nurses back off.]
Finn: MY WAY!!
[He runs out of the house and into the forest, screaming. He finally comes to a stop. He's staring at a tree stump with a sign. The road splits up into two paths.]
Finn: Hmmm...
Tree Stump: Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.
Finn: Isn't there another way?
Tree Stump: Nope.
Finn: But what if I just went—
Tree Stump: No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing—is the only—way.
[The camera zooms in on Finn's face. A thought of the head Clown Nurse crosses his mind.]
Head Clown Nurse: It's the only way! [laughs]
[Finn suddenly screams and confronts the tree stump.]
Tree Stump: Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!
Finn: NO! I choose MY WAY!! [He kicks the sign off of her head.] My way.
[Finn runs right through the prickly bushes, screaming all the way. He comes out on the other side, all scratched and covered in thorns. He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank. A bush is on the bank nearby.]
Bush: Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.
Finn: Wha...? [Beats] I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
Bush: You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.
[While the bush speaks, the camera shows the river's current flowing, and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away. The bridge nearby is shown, then two pairs of eyes and shadowy arms pop out. Two electric eels are swimming under the water, their bodies surging with electricity.]
Finn: But I need to get across.
Bush: Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.
[Another thought of a Clown Nurse crosses Finn's mind. He advances on the bush.]
Finn: Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
Bush: Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, Globbit"? Who's Globbit?
[Finn snatches the bush and uproots him.]
Finn: MY WAY!!
[A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river, using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath. The bush is screaming in pain all the while. Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn, shocking him and singing off the bush's leaves. Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him. Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water.]
Bush: Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!
Finn: NO, MY WAY!! [Frustrated, Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river. Then he dives in. He emerges from the river, screaming and steaming from the pineapple juice-like water. He then happens upon a strange little man standing next to a wagon with watermelons in it.]
Finn: [panting] MY WAY! [He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head.] Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
Pan: Uhh, excuse me, friend. [Finn blabbers his lips together.] You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.
[Still frustrated as ever, Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon.]
Finn: [panting] MY WAY! [He hurls the wagon down the hill. The wagon shatters as it hits the ground, and the melons tumble down the hill.]
Pan: Watch out, Rainy!
[Rainy realizes too late. She avoids the first one, which rolls over the wigwam house, but the others roll over her, injuring her. Rainy groans in pain.]
Pan: [gasps] Rainy!
Finn: Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
Pan: Yeah? [sobs] No doy... friend.
Finn: But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
Pan: Just get out of here! Leave us alone!
Finn: Uh... wh... I... [sighs]
Pan: Psycho fink.
[Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below. He realizes his plan didn't go as well as he had hoped. He takes off his hat and breaks out in song.]
Finn: ♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? [Finn puts his hat back on.] How did I go... too far? ♫
[As Finn finishes his song, the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff. A giant eye opens up, looks up, and blinks. Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff. It's the Cyclops Finn has been seeking.]
Forest Cyclops: Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.
Finn: I don't want 'em anymore.
Forest Cyclops: What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?
Finn: No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
Forest Cyclops: You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!
Finn: Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
Forest Cyclops: YOU'RE LYING!
Finn: I'M NOT LYING!!!
Forest Cyclops: [Beat] You stink at lying.
Finn: Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
Forest Cyclops: Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!
Finn: Huh? [The Cyclops pounds him into the ground.]
Forest Cyclops: Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!
[Finn glances up at the Cyclops' eye. He notices water forming up in the big, round eye.]
Finn: [mutters]
Forest Cyclops: Whuh... What?
Finn: [mutters]
Forest Cyclops: What? I can't hear you.
Finn: I said... MY WAY!!
[Finn punches the Cyclops in the eye. The Cyclops starts crying as he screams in pain. Some of the tears fall onto Finn. His clothes are made anew.]
Finn: Magical tear drops. [He pulls off the bandage. His foot has been healed completely. He wiggles his toes.] My way can still work! Yeah!
[Finn pulls off the Cyclops' head. Finn first goes to Pan, who is still sobbing. Finn pours the Cyclops' tears over Rainy, who is restored.]
Rainy: Huh? I'm okay.
Pan: Yay!
[Finn runs off. He then goes to the bare bush and pours the Cyclops' tears over him.]
Bush: Huh? [The bush takes root, and all his leaves regrow.] Whoa!
[The stump is sobbing in pain from having her sign knocked off. Finn pours the Cyclops' tears over her, and a flower grows where the sign was.]
Tree Stump: Huh? Whoo-hoo.
[Finally, Finn pours Cyclops' tears over a ham sandwich at a picnic, bringing it to life.]
Ham Sandwich: Yeah!
[The scene cuts back to the Tree Fort, where the Clown Nurses are still doing their so-called duties. The big Clown Nurse is still kissing Jake's bandaged foot.]
Jake: Oh, yeah. Huh?
[The door suddenly slams open. Everyone gasps in shock. Finn walks in, still carrying the Cyclops' head.]
Head Clown Nurse: Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?
[Finn throws the Cyclops' head. It lands in front of the head Clown Nurse, who gasps.]
Finn: Kiss that!
Head Clown Nurse: Oh, my! You look horribly injured! My kisses will make heal you. [She smooches the Cyclops' eye.] Now how does that feel?
Forest Cyclops: Bittersweet.
[Finn walks over to Jake, carrying a bottle of Cyclops' tears.]
Finn: Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
Jake: Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better. [To nurse] Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. [The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching Jake's foot.]
Finn: You're gross.
Jake: Hey! We all have our own ways.
Finn: [realizing] You know what? You're... right.
[Jake's eyes twinkle. The episode ends.]
[The episode begins in the Tree Fort's kitchen, where Jake is preparing a meal.]
Jake: [sets table] Finn, lunch is ready!
Finn: [holds nose] Ugh, what are you cooking?
Jake: It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn.
Finn: I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.
Jake: Dude, this took me, like—
Finn: Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! [grabs Jake's arm]
Jake: Whoa! [grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves] Eh.
[Scene changes to Tree Trunks' house.]
Finn: [knocking on door] Tree Trunks! [opens door and walks in with Jake] [gasps]
[Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table, motionless.]
Finn: [running over to her] Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks: [mumbling] Apples... my apples...
Jake: Apples?
Tree Trunks: You! [jumps at Jake] You took my apples! [starts hitting Jake]
Finn: Whoa, whoa! [grabs Tree Trunks] Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!
Tree Trunks: Finn... and, and Jake?
Finn: It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.
Tree Trunks: [tearing up] They took 'em. They took all of 'em.
Jake: All of what?
Tree Trunks: Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.
Finn & Jake: NOOOOOOOO!
Finn: Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.
Tree Trunks: Let me show you the crime scene. [leads them outside] You see, boys: scads of apple trees but, but no apples.
Finn: Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks: No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.
Finn: Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?
Jake: [patting the air] No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. [feeling something invisible] Oh, no. No.
Finn: Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?
Tree Trunks: Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—
Jake: Hey, guys, I found something! Look!
[Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole.]
Tree Trunks: Uh!
Raggedy Princess: Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.
Finn: Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?
Raggedy Princess: Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time. [laughs nervously] I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.
Tree Trunks: Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. [flapping ears] I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!
Finn: [laughs] Awesome. Where do we find these guys?
Jake: Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.
Finn: [jaw drops with "brring" sound effect]
Jake: Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.
Finn: [jaw still hanging, with higher "brring" sound effect]
Tree Trunks: Okay, you two, let's get going.
[Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern. Someone gets thrown out of the window.]
Candy Tavern Person: Whoa!
Tree Trunks: [gasps] Oh, my!
[The three enter the tavern. A Candy Person at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon, and an angry cookie shakes.]
Finn: Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?
Jake: Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.
Finn: Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks: Okay, I won't.
[The three walk up to the Candy Tavern Bartender.]
Finn & Tree Trunks: Where—?
Finn: Oh. [motions for Tree Trunks to continue]
Tree Trunks: Where's my dang apples?
Finn: Oh, [laughs] Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?
Bartender: "Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'.
Finn: What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
Bartender: Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some [pounds bar] do-gooders!
Jake: Hold on, we gotta go potty.
[The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies.]
Finn: Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.
Tree Trunks: [licking toilet paper] This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.
Finn: Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that. [sighs] Here. [holds her up to the mirror] [whispers to Jake] You gotta watch her, man!
Tree Trunks: Oh, I look just like an army brat!
[The three return to the bartender.]
Bartender: What can I do for you?
Finn: [pouring drink onto bar] You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? [drops mug onto the floor, shattering it]
Bartender: Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you.
[He leads them to a back door and opens it to a tall gingerbread man and an upside-down ice cream cone.]
Bartender: Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples?
Jaybird: [scratches chin] Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge.
[Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake.]
Jaybird: Grab 'em!
[The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks.]
Jaybird: You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!
Finn: Wha-what boss?
Jaybird: Your boss! Dr. J?
Finn: We don't know any Dr. J.
Jaybird: [punches Finn's forehead] Liars! Come on, Smudge [walks off] [mumbling] ...gonna take my apples.
[The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door. Jake takes the trash can off.]
Jake: What just happened?
Finn: I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!
Tree Trunks: Finn? Finn.
Finn: Hm?
Tree Trunks: This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.
Finn: Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.
Jake: Hey, Finn.
Finn: Hm?
Jake: [pointing to mark] What's that on your face, buddy?
Finn: Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.
Jake: Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.
Finn: What?!
Jake: I didn't know it was wrong.
[Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: [points to a building with the mark] Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.
[The three walk up to the building.]
Finn: [knocks on the door] Hello?
Wormo: [through door] Who's the heck happening? What?
Finn: Uh, we're here about the apples?
Wormo: Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.
Finn: Um...
Jake: Here. [forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo]
Wormo: [opens door] Come on in. Follow this guy. [leads them in]
[Before the door closes, someone stops it with their foot.]
Wormo: [leading them downstairs] My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. [shows them a crate of diamonds]
Finn: What the?
Wormo: What's wrong, guy?
Finn: These aren't apples.
Wormo: Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."
Jaybird: [opening door] Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?! [points to Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks] What are they doing here?
Wormo: They're here for the apples.
Jaybird: That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!
[Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks are tied up.]
Tree Trunks: Um, sir? [laughs nervously] I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.
Wormo: Feed 'em to the pig.
Smudge: Yeah, the pig.
Jaybird: Heheh, yeah, all right. [walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr. Pig]
Mr. Pig: Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick.
Dr. J: Hold it!
[Dr. J and his gang appear.]
Jaybird: Dr. J! [drops pig]
Dr. J: Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.
Jaybird & Dr. J: [in unison] Get 'em, boys!
[While the gangs fight, Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope, and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks' house.]
Tree Trunks: [starts sobbing]
Finn: Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks: But we're never gonna find those apples.
Mr. Pig: Apples? You guys looking for apples?
Jake: Uh, yeah, why?
Mr. Pig: 'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.
Jake: Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?
Mr. Pig: No.
Jake: "Apples" as "apples"?
Mr. Pig: Yep.
Finn: You mean apples that we eat?
Mr. Pig: Yes.
Tree Trunks: With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.
Mr. Pig: I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet. [points to wardrobe] They sound scared.
Tree Trunks: Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. [sticks tail into keyhole] You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. [opens it]
[Dozens of apples spill out.]
Finn & Jake: [gasp]
Tree Trunks: Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.
Finn: No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.
Tree Trunks: No, Finn, I'm a criminal, [picks up phone and dials 911] and I need to pay the price.
Banana Guard [over phone]: Banana Guard speaking.
Tree Trunks: Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.
[Finn and Jake exchange sad looks.]
[Scene changes to outside the house, with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by.]
Finn: Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.
Tree Trunks: Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.
Finn: Tree Trunks.
Banana Guard: Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.
[Several crows fly out of the forest.]
Banana Guard: This place could use a scarecrow.
Finn: Huh? Wait, what'd you say?
Banana Guard: Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn: A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.
Banana Guard [in Finn's memory]: Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn: That's it! [climbs onto Tree Trunks' house's roof] I knew it!
[A nest is next to a hole in the roof. A magpie brings an apple to its chicks, but the apple falls into the hole.]
Finn: The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!
Jake: And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!
Finn: Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!
Tree Trunks: Does this mean I'm innocent?
Jake: As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!
Finn: [jumps off roof] [laughs] Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks: I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. [strains and breaks the handcuffs]
Banana Guards: Whoa.
Tree Trunks: [to Banana Guards] Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. [slaps Banana Guard]
Banana Guard: She slapped my butt!
[The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up.]
Tree Trunks: [laughs]
[The others join in.]
[Cinnamon Bun, in a tuxedo, walks while carrying a tray of apple cider to Princess Bubblegum.]
Princess Bubblegum: Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.
Cinnamon Bun: Oh, oh, "around for us." I thought you said "walk to the zoo and back"!
Princess Bubblegum: Gob. [smacks forehead]
[Cinnamon Bun walks away and Princess Bubblegum sighs and follows him to Finn.]
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.
[Finn walks out.]
Princess Bubblegum: As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you. [hands a badge to Finn] So, you know, no holds barred, got it?
Finn: [giggles] Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?
Princess Bubblegum: Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.
[Jake is being tickled by 5 baby pigs.]
Princess Bubblegum: I kinda don't want squash his groove.
[Princess Bubblegum opens a door.]
Princess Bubblegum: Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks: Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.
Princess Bubblegum: [giggles and closes the door behind her] Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.
Tree Trunks: Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.
Princess Bubblegum: What?! Why not?
Tree Trunks: Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote "authority" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo.
Princess Bubblegum: WHAT? That fraud?!
Tree Trunks: Now I know...
Princess Bubblegum: That fraud is here?!
Tree Trunks: Why, yes, but...
[Princess Bubblegum leaves and slams the door.]
Tree Trunks: Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.
Tree Trunks' mother: Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably jealous 'cause you're about to marry a handsome, fine, saucy man. Oh, but he is a saucy, fine bologna factory. Mmmhmm, tell you what: I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made!
Tree Trunks: Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!
Tree Trunks' mother: Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory!
Tree Trunks: Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?
[Meanwhile, His Holiness, the King of Ooo, is outside with Mr. Pig's relatives.]
King of Ooo: Please, go on. Describe the next thought form.
Mr. Pig's relative: Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches.
King of Ooo: Ah... Ahaha! [taps the relative with his wand] One year good luck.
[Mr. Pig's relatives are all amused. Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum is hiding by a bush and is spying on the King of Ooo.]
Princess Bubblegum: I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!
[BMO laughs while spinning on the chair.]
BMO: Yay! [giggles]
Wyatt: Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders?
Cinnamon Bun: Sure! [takes out the bottle of apple cider and tries to do a trick but has difficulty taking the cork out.]
Wyatt: Hey, little robot. How ya doing?
BMO: I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!
Wyatt: Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?
BMO: No!
Wyatt: Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?
BMO: No...
Wyatt: Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!
BMO: No.
Wyatt: Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?
BMO: No.
[Mr Pig's relative runs and pushes another guest down.]
Mr. Pig's relative: It's starting! The ceremony is starting! [snorts]
[The scene moves to the wedding ceremony.]
[King of Ooo signals Jake to start playing music. Jake prepares to play his viola and his toe presses the play button of the radio. He plays the viola and the pig throws flower petals from her basket. All the guests turn to Tree Trunks, who is holding a bouquet of flowers. Mr. Pig sheds a tear.]
BMO: [gasp] Oh no! I'm missing the love! [gets off her stool]
Wyatt: No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.
BMO: [sadly]Oh, okay... [sits down again]
[Tree Trunks walk to Mr. Pig]
Mr Pig: Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.
Tree Trunks: Shh...
[Finn is watching from afar.]
Finn: Sounds really sweet.
[Finn hears some rustling from the bushes and gets up.]
Finn: Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?
Lumpy Space Princess: Let me go to this party...
[A crow flies out, frightening Finn.]
Finn: It's not your party, LSP. [tries to find Lumpy Space Princess.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Poor Finn. Don't you know? [flies up from an old well. The wind blows the picnic mat off Lumpy Space Princess, revealing her in a wedding dress. After all, no wedding's complete without wedding crashers...] Every party is my party.
[Finn grunts and walks towards Lumpy Space Princess. Meanwhile, Jake is "playing" the viola, with the 5 baby pigs sleeping around his feet. The scene then moves on to Princess Bubblegum climbing a ladder to the King's blimp.]
Princess Bubblegum: I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp. [gets on the top of the ladder and turns the door knob] Make sure everything's in accordance... [breaks open the window with her shoe and opens the door] with the laws.
Mr. Pig: Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?
[Tree Trunks is walking back, and far away are Finn and Lumpy Space Princess continuing their scuffle. Finn tries to block Lumpy Space Princess's way.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Get out of my way, Finn. [pushes Finn] Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!
[Tree Trunks walks to the stage.]
King of Ooo: Okay, dear, now up you come.
Tree Trunks: [whispers] Don't hurry this. [she slowly takes a step on the stage and King of Ooo lifts her up and brings her on stage.]
King of Ooo: There you go!
[Mr Pig and Tree Trunks kiss for a while but King of Ooo push them back.]
King of Ooo: Whoa, whoa, kids! Gotta finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket!
[Lumpy Space Princess tries to get to the ceremony as Finn is pulling her by the dress.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes!
["Finn grunts and his foot meets a rock and flings her to a tent.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah...
King of Ooo: We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks, the little elephant. These two weird animals...
[BMO is still watching from afar.]
BMO: I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.
[Cinnamon Bun still struggles to take the cork out.]
Wyatt: [sighs] BMO, you're so nice.
BMO: Those flowers look really cold.
Wyatt: I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby.
BMO: Yeah, cute nice babies.
Wyatt: BMO?
BMO: Mm-hmm?
Wyatt: BMO, would you move in with me?
[BMO gasps loudly as its eyes widen and runs into the forest.]
King of Ooo: Do you, Mr Pig, take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me the true King of Ooo?
[Cinnamon Bun is seen shaking the bottle of cider.]
Mr. Pig: I do.
[Princess Bubblegum grumbles, steers the blimp and pulls down a lever while stepping on the pedal.]
King of Ooo: Do you, Tree Trunks, do you promise to love Mr. Pig forever, and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs, [Mr. Pig puts the ring around Tree Trunk's paw] to have and to hold the in sickness and in health, in my gated mountain compound?
Tree Trunks: I...
Lumpy Space Princess: Everybody get ready... [ as she crawls to the ceremony, still with Finn pulling her] to pay attention to me...
Tree Trunks: I...
[Cinnamon Bun is still shaking the bottle of cider faster]
Tree Trunks: do... oh [looks over to Finn and Lumpy Space Princess right behind the guests, struggling to get closer. The blimp is also getting closer to the stage]
Lumpy Space Princess: Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq- [gets knocked by the blimp.]
[Princess Bubblegum gets off the blimp before it literally crashes the ceremony. Mr. Pig's mother is seen crying profusely and shaking her head. Cinnamon Bun shakes the bottle of cider and the cork is finally out.]
Cinnamon Bun: Ah... [pours the cider into Wyatt's glass.]
King of Ooo: My zep!
Princess Bubblegum: Everybody! This wedding is a farce! A criminal farce!
King of Ooo: Hey, just what are you egging at here?
Princess Bubblegum: I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license!
King of Ooo: Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records! I have the up-to-date paperwork right here!
Tree Trunks: Oh!
Princess Bubblegum: What? Uh...
King of Ooo: Hey, wait, how did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep.
Princess Bubblegum: No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail! [handcuffs King of Ooo] Yeah!
Tree Trunks: Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.
[Finn walks while grabbing a knocked out Lumpy Space Princess]
Finn: Hey, everybody.
Tree Trunks: Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us.
[All the guests are imprisoned. You and your big mouth, Tree Trunks.]
Tree Trunks: Oh, poor Tree Trunks. Wait, where's my mama? Has anyone seen my... oh!
[Tree Trunk's mother and Wyatt are seen kissing.]
Tree Trunks: No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie. [telepathic signals enter her head] Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming!
Mr Pig: Wait, Tree Trunks. Look around: everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, Banana Guard Number 1, Jake, Jake Junior, everybody. We can have the ceremony right here.
Tree Trunks: Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors?
[King of Ooo is seen biting the candy bars.]
King of Ooo: Are you crazy? That loopy bird is gonna string me up sideways. You can perform your own dang ceremony. Kingofooo.com! [escapes]
Tree Trunks: Oh, dear.
Mr Pig: Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear?
Tree Trunks: Huh?
Mr Pig: The King said you can perform your own dang ceremony!
Tree Trunks: Yeah, that really stunk.
Mr Pig: But...
Tree Trunks: But... the King's word is law. I can perform my own dang ceremony?
Jake: Are you up to it, TT?
Tree Trunks: I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready?
[Mr Pig nods]
Tree Trunks: Oh. Okay, um... do you Mr Pig take me, Tree Trunks, to be your beautiful wedded wife?
Mr Pig: I do.
Tree Trunks: And do I, Mr Pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, Tree Trunks?
Mr Pig: I do.
Tree Trunks: Then you... you may kiss the bride!
[They kiss and Princess Bubblegum cry while watching them at the security camera.]
Princess Bubblegum: Aww, geez, let them all go, Banana Guard Number 3.
Banana Guard Number 3: Uh... what?
Princess Bubblegum: I just can't stay mad at something so cute.
Banana Guard: Did she just say let everyone go?
[Banana Guard Number 3 shrugs and the Banana Guard presses a button and the prison cell doors open and everyone including other criminals run out except for Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig.]
Tree Trunks: Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying.
[Princess Bubblegum cries while sipping her drink and watching them.]
Mr Pig: Wait, d-don't you think there might be cameras down here?
Tree Trunks: I hope so...
[Princess Bubblegum grimaces with an upraised eyebrow.]
[The episode ends]
[episode starts with scene goes down here.]
Lumpy Space Princess: So then Melissa's like, "What do you think of him?" and I'm all, "Well he's no ray of sunshine or whatever. You know these people you just get, like, neggy vibes from?
Finn: Yeah. Like bad jubies or something?
Lumpy Space Princess: Totally, They just put everyone in a whack mood with their baaaaad jubies!
[Jake and BMO crash into Finn and LSP while sledding]
Jake: Hehe, whoops.
Finn: Oh man, my body feels weird.
Jake: Uh dude - that's cuz you just got glide-sliced by the ice duo. Hehe.
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah, my body feels weird too - here Finn, feel this...
[LSP grabs Finn's arm, forcing his hand upon her body]
Finn: Ah! [Alert shows on BMO screen]
Jake: Whoa! Too much electricity to the noggin, bro! He'll be fine.
[BMO changing the face before the National Weather Service few seconds]
BMO: Oh!
Jake: See?...Fine.
BMO: [laughing] That was weird.
[BMO's screen changes into the unknown weather reporter for storm alert (static-like sound)]
Unknown: This is a storm alert from the automated weather service in effect for the grasslands and all surrounding areas. Residents must evacuate or seek shelter immediately.

Finn swings ax, but he screams with my body lifts up slightly will force of swing, Ax stays stuck on tree, Finn's Hand lifts off as well. Finn Realizes.]

[Camera shwips pans over to house.]

Lumpy Space Princess: Chill, homie. Nobody's home, it's like abandoned or something.
Finn: Yeah...................okaaaaaay.
[BMO hold a water buckets continues walking and sets down water buckets, pick up empty pails, Ax comes out quick. Finn is humming to himself.]

Finn: Jake! He hates lightning! [Jake dives to the bunker. Finn's head still not hurts. Jake stands up.] Jake you're back!
Jake: Yeah.
Finn: So whatja bring man? [BMO and LSP are angry as well.] Working on something big.
Jake: Well........[Jake's pocket holds notebook.] I've been Jottin' some stuff down in my notebook.
Finn: Oh cool. Like survival tips in junk?
Jake: No not really, it's more like..um...It's a surprise!
Finn: Oh. So you didn't bring anything. [Here comes the thunderstorm and lightning.] Oh snap! Gotta seal the door! [He run up the ladder.] BMO, lights this baby up!
BMO: [Turns lights on.] Oo!
Jake and Lumpy Space Princess: Ooooo!
Finn: Okay all boarded up! [He is muscle his arms.] Now we wait.
[She wait 1 1/2 second to talk Lumpy Space Princess.]
Lumpy Space Princess: We just wait? That's it? Can we at least play a game or something i'm already bored.
Finn: Sure what game?
Lumpy Space Princess: Spin the bottle.
Jake: YEGH!
Finn: Sorry LSP, Ain't got no bottles.
[LSP get the water bottle and drink 3 gulps into a water.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Yes we do. [LSP gurps.]
Finn: YO! What gives! We gotta ration that water!
Lumpy Space Princess: I HAVE NEEDS FINN! [He brakes the bottle.] Just sit there than! I'll be texting brad up until you change your mi-
[Phone says "NO SERVICE" for 3 drums, phone fail off, body gose down, when starts sleeping.]
Jake: And that's why you sould never rely on teginology, no offense BMO.
[Jake walks away.]
BMO: Is she okay?
Finn: Yeah, i think she's already asleep.
[LSP is sleeping as well, everybody waits for come out, Everybody starts asleep, Jake wakes up to eat chips, LSP wakes up to going. BMO lining up rocks, Jake is making dirt angels, The little later, when Finn wakes up as well.]
Finn: H....hey, you guys hungry?
Jake: Hmhmm.
BMO: Hangry.
Finn: Yo LSP, thow me some chips.
Lumpy Space Princess: [LSP chumps chips.] No more chips.
Finn: How bout some o' dem bean-beans?
Lumpy Space Princess: Nope, No more. Looks like we got a can of.....Beet Something.
Finn: Wait-What?! Is that all it's left?
Lumpy Space Princess: I was hungies!
Finn: You ate all that FOOD?!! I cant beileve you?!
Lumpy Space Princess: Whatever Finn! I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to..not...die! [The top of LSP's head is hurts as well.] OUUGH!
[Finn, Jake, and BMO gasps, the food trash gets sucked out of the bunker.]
BMO: Finn! The door! You were supposed to secure the door!
Finn: BMO, you saw me do it! [Cut scence to LSP to Jake.] That food must be bunk or something.
Jake: Yeah i think this food's bunk too, expires in.........29 years ago.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh glob. [LSP screams and runs away.]
BMO: I knew raiding that house was a bad idea!
Finn: Well, maybe maybe I could've built something better if I had some help from, oh, I don't know, my best friend!
Lumpy Space Princess: Aaah! [Zap!]
Finn: Nooo! [Thunder crashes] [Lsp grumbling]
Jake: BMO!
BMO: [Beeps] What'd I miss?! Why is it dark now?
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah, I broke it. Whatever.
Jake: Guys, I think this storm is more than just some scary clouds and weather junk. We've been treating each other like ding-dongs since we've been down here.
Lumpy Space Princess: Duh! This bunker is the worst!
Jake: Nah, nah. I think this storm's carrying some Major negative energy or something.
Finn: Bad jubies.
Jake: It's making us all go nanners! I think I can help, though. Let me show you what I've been working on. [Clears throat] [Inhales deeply] [Imitates bird chirping] [Imitates stream flowing, frog croaking] [Inhales deeply] [Imitates birds chirping]
BMO: It is so beautiful! [Chirping, croaking continue] [Clears throat] [Gasps] [Whistling, croaking rhythmically] [Beatboxing] [Alarm blares] [Crash!]
Jake: Holy tornado twins! [Thunder crashes]
Tornado Man: Peek-a-boo! I'mma hurt you!
Jake: No!
Finn: Don't hurt us!
Tornado Man: But I only feel good about myself when I knock other people down! [Laughs evilly]
Jake: I told you, man! This storm's got an attitude problem!
Finn: Jake, you got to help us get back to our happy place. The only way to fight bad jubies is with good jubies! [Beatboxing, chirping, croaking] [Thunder crashes]
Jake: Aah! Finn, I can't keep this up solo!
Finn: But we can't make all those sounds!
Jake: No time to be self-conscious, man! [Echoing] Get on this beat! [Beatboxing]
Finn: Swish! Swish! Brrn-ka! Swish! Swish!
Lumpy Space Princess: [Chirping] Caw! C-caw! Whoa!
Finn: Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!
Tornado Man: What are those noises?!
Finn: The sound of good vibes!
Jake: Yeah! The dope beats of life!
Tornado Man: [Rain pouring] It makes me feel some type of way.
Jake: How about you pause that stormin' for a sec so you can hear the rest of it? [Rain, thunder stop] [Imitates birds chirping]
Tornado Man: Wait. Wait, wait. That one. Wh-wh-what's that one?
Lumpy Space Princess: [Cawing]
Tornado Man: No, no, no. That "tweet tweet" one. [Imitates birds chirping] Yes! Ohh I haven't heard that sound since I was a baby breeze.
Jake: What? You forgot what a bird sounds like? No wonder you're depressed! You know, you should really stop and slow down more often.
Finn: Yeah. You get to hear life happening. Makes you feel good.
Tornado Man: [Inhales deeply] Ahhhh. You're right! I've been a freaky storm for so long that I forgot it's okay to be a breeze sometimes. I-if you'll excuse me, I'm going to explore the rest of this beautiful day.
Jake: Wait! Here, man. Take my notebook. It's got the sheet music to my jam.
Tornado Man: Really? You would do that?
Jake: Yeah, just take it.
Tornado Man: [Wind howling] Thank you so much, stretchy dog. This is one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. Outey!
Lumpy Space Princess: Yes! The sun!
Finn: Hoo-hoo!
BMO: I am sorry we doubted you, Jake.
Lumpy Space Princess: Ditto.
Finn: Proud of you, man.
Lumpy Space Princess: [Eagle screeches] Aah!
[In a room in the Candy Castle, Princess Bubblegum is playing trumpet to Finn, Jake, Embryo Princess, the Punch Bowl, and a mudscamp. She finishes, her audience applauds, and she catches her breath.]
Princess Bubblegum: [exhales] Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume. [slips on the gloves and lifts the sphere] I made special gloves for it.
[Finn gives a thumbs up.]
Princess Bubblegum: [places the sphere around two small creatures] Now check it out! It's logging time.
[The creatures blabber indistinctly as one drinks from a thimble. It sprays the drink upward into a mist and starts kissing the other one as the mist falls over them. They then continue blabbering.]
Princess Bubblegum: I'll set the clock back now. [swipes her glove]
[The two creatures back away as they watch their past selves rewind.]
Princess Bubblegum: Now I'll push the time travel button.
[The two creatures scream as their molecules reset to where they were when the sphere was first placed around them. They continue blabbering.]
Jake: Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic.
Mudscamp: Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, Princess. Thank you for inviting me.
Princess Bubblegum: No!
[Lumpy Space Princess is shown sleeping in the gutter outside.]
Princess Bubblegum: For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time.
[Lumpy Space Princess wakes up.]
Jake: Eh, I guess, but not really.
[Lumpy Space Princess peaks through the open window.]
Jake: I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic.
[Lumpy Space Princess sneaks in and slithers under Jake's chair.]
Mudscamp: Hey, time, where's my fiancée? Am I right? [jingles bell]
Jake: [laughs]
Princess Bubblegum: Jake, don't deny my science. This is a time travel machine.
[Lumpy Space Princess's eyes widen. She throws aside Jake's chair with him still in it and floats toward the sphere.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me! [stuffs herself in the sphere, screaming]
Princess Bubblegum: LSP...
Lumpy Space Princess: Wha?
Princess Bubblegum: LSP, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves.
Lumpy Space Princess: [quietly] Give them to me.
Princess Bubblegum: No.
Lumpy Space Princess: You witch! Give them to me now! [pounds table]
Princess Bubblegum: No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to—
Lumpy Space Princess: [jumps on her] You skunk! [tearing out Princess Bubblegum's hair] You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns!
[Princess Bubblegum hits her with her crown, knocking her into a bookshelf.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Glob! [pants]
Princess Bubblegum: Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately.
Lumpy Space Princess: I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y... [floats toward the door] I'm sorry you're so [quietly] stupid. [slams door]
Jake & Punch Bowl: Whoa! [laugh]
Princess Bubblegum: Sheesh!
[At the Candy Tavern, Tree Trunks is singing "Slow Boat to China" to Mr. Pig while various other Candy Tavern People sit around.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you?
Bartender: Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies.
Lumpy Space Princess: This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life! [sighs]
Bartender: Another cucumber water, Your Majesty?
[Lumpy Space Princess nods, and Charlie leaves. Lumpy Space Princess notices a blue Lumpy Space Person staring at her.]
Lumpy Space Princess: What?
Lumpy Space Person: Oh, I—I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I—I know you. We used to—
Lumpy Space Princess: Everyone knows me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Person: No, uh, from high school. W-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie.
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugly Johnnie?
Johnnie: Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit.
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore! Come on, sit up straight. Lemme see them eyes.
Johnnie: Mm.
Lumpy Space Princess: Do it.
[He sits up straight and stares at Lumpy Space Princess.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Nope. Can't call you that anymore. [laughs and pounds the bar] So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie?
Johnnie: Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas.
Lumpy Space Princess: Mm-hmm. [moves her chair closer to his]
Johnnie: And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak.
Lumpy Space Princess: That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever.
Johnnie: To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow.
Lumpy Space Princess: Why, Johnnie?
Johnnie: I'm bad at talking to people.
Lumpy Space Princess: That's because you have poor posture.
Johnnie: Really?
Lumpy Space Princess: You gotta stop slouching!
[Johnnie sits up straight.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Now look me in the eye!
[He does so.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah, stay like that.
Johnnie: Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself.
Lumpy Space Princess: You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So... where are you staying while you're in town?
Johnnie: I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment.
Lumpy Space Princess: Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.
[They arrive at Johnnie's apartment. Johnnie points to a chair.]
Johnnie: That chair—oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it.
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own.
Johnnie: Thanks.
Lumpy Space Princess: Ooh, records! [goes through the records and pulls out one with a face] Okay, wanna see something funny?
Johnnie: Yeah.
Lumpy Space Princess: Okay. Okay. [laughs] Sit down!
[The two sit on the couch.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Okay, are you ready?
Johnnie: Heh-heh, yeah!
Lumpy Space Princess: [laughs] Okay! [puts record over her face]
Johnnie: [laughs] It's his face, but on your body!
Lumpy Space Princess: I know! That's the joke. My friend Melissa and I came up with that. You're smart that you get it.
Johnnie: Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts!
Lumpy Space Princess: I feel the same way, Johnnie.
Johnnie: Do you feel this couch?
Lumpy Space Princess: [laughs nervously] What?
Johnnie: 'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!
[They both laugh.]
Johnnie: Seriously. It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home. So I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully... and dreaming about you.
Lumpy Space Princess: [embarrassed] Johnnie...
Johnnie: Thank you... for everything. [kisses her hand]
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie... go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow.
Johnnie: Good night! [turns off light and closes door]
[In the morning, Johnnie opens his door.]
Johnnie: Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got— [sees empty couch] oh. [sadly] I guess she'll be the one who got away. [turns and sees Lumpy Space Princess in the kitchen]
Lumpy Space Princess: Looking for someone?
Johnnie: You're still here!
Lumpy Space Princess: 'Course I am! Now make me some breakfast! [drums table]
[After breakfast]
Lumpy Space Princess: Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting. And remember, I'll be right over there, [points to couch] sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum.
[Her words echo in Johnnie's head as he sits in a chair waiting for the meeting.]
Banana Guard: Yo, why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess?
Johnnie: Nope! My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes.
[At Johnnie's apartment, Lumpy Space Princess is slouched on the couch in front of the TV.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels.
[Time card: 45 MINUTES LATER]
Lumpy Space Princess: Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb. [looks at nonexistent watch] Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! I wonder how it went.
[The light turns on.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie! Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go? Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie!
Johnnie: I did it, babe! I landed the sale!
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie, that's wonderful!
Johnnie: And I couldn't have done it without you.
Lumpy Space Princess: I know!
Johnnie: And here's the best part! She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, my Glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been a while.
Johnnie: Oh. No. It's a business meeting, not social. Just me and the princess, I'm afraid.
Lumpy Space Princess: What?! [storms out]
Johnnie: LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess: So... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory? Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions? [floats by a mudscamp] Yo, think again, tranch.
Mudscamp: Who—who are you talking to?
[The scene cuts to the royal dinner.]
Princess Bubblegum: So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom?
Johnnie: Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern.
Princess Bubblegum: That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now tell me more about gas...
Lumpy Space Princess: [watching from outside] Oh, Johnnie... Ugly Johnnie, through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly. [sighs] Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes, and thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling. Heh. To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know... if I can be that big. [lights Molotov cocktail and throws it through a window] Rah! [pulls wires from beneath a truck, causing it to roll] Eh, ehh.
[The truck rolls up the castle steps and explodes inside, rocking the whole castle.]
Princess Bubblegum: [gasps] We're under attack! [runs out]
Johnnie: Can I help?
Princess Bubblegum: No. Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door. [closes door]
Johnnie: Okay. [hides under table]
Lumpy Space Princess: [lifts up tablecloth] Hi, Johnnie.
Johnnie: [gasps] What are you doing here?
Lumpy Space Princess: I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern—back to when you loved me—so we can have a second chance.
Johnnie: What?
[Lumpy Space Princess places the sphere around Johnnie's head and pushes a button on her glove, sending Johnnie's head's molecules into limbo.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Uh! [does the same to Johnnie's body] [laughs]
[At the site of the explosion, Manfried is fighting the fire with a garden hose.]
Princess Bubblegum: Manfried, where are the Banana Guards?
Manfried: Take a chill pill, Princess. I handled it.
Princess Bubblegum: What did you handle?
Manfried: You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it.
Princess Bubblegum: Mmm. [runs back to the dining room and kicks down the door] Don't chew it! Don't chew it! Don't chew it! [flips table, finding the time travel machine]
[At the Candy Tavern, Tree Trunks is still singing the same song while Lumpy Space Princess is looking around expectantly.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Johnnie? C'mon. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Ha-ha. Uh.
Princess Bubblegum: He's not here.
Lumpy Space Princess: [gasps] What? But I sent him back.
Princess Bubblegum: The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function.
Lumpy Space Princess: Well, then where is he?
Princess Bubblegum: I don't know.
[Johnnie's head begins materializing in the border around the screen.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [crying] Then if he's gone, can you send me back...?
[Johnnie's body materializes in the border.]
Lumpy Space Princess: To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?!
Princess Bubblegum: If that's what you want.
Lumpy Space Princess: Do it. Do it!
[Princess Bubblegum places the sphere around Lumpy Space Princess and pushes buttons on her glove, sending Lumpy Space Princess's molecules back to when she first entered the sphere. Meanwhile, in the border, Johnnie reunites his head and body.]
Lumpy Space Princess: You witch! Give them to—huh, wha? What? Where are we?
[Johnnie reaches out to Lumpy Space Princess.]
Princess Bubblegum: You asked me to use this.
Lumpy Space Princess: Don't touch me! [floats away] You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns...! [floats out the window]
[Johnnie bows his head, crestfallen, as the border fades to black.]
Princess Bubblegum: [sighs] [sits down and pours herself a drink]
[Episode starts at Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. BMO climbs into a dark room with assorted objects.]
BMO: Hello?
[BMO climbs down a ladder to get into the room. He finds a cardboard box and hides underneath it. He starts chuckling. On his screen, a digital hand selects some files. The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can, deleting them. BMO's screen glitches, and BMO seems woozy. He chuckles and then looks normal. Scene switches to outside of the box. We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box. He still seems dizzy. We see him selecting the file "CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys" and then deleting it. The scene shows his face, which turns from a smile into a frown. BMO's screen glitches out wildly as BMO moans. BMO gets up and wanders around for a second, before falling over. The screen is blank.]
Finn: BMO?
[Scene shows Finn and Jake looking down at something. The image is distorted.]
Jake: BMO?
[BMO is lying in a bed. BMO wakes up.]
Finn: BMO, are you okay?
Jake: What did you do?
BMO: It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. [BMO repeats 'do noth-' because of his system glitching.]
Finn: Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
BMO: No, no. I am fine. Really. [BMO's screen glitches out and BMO yells in pain. He emits smoke and stops glitching.] Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
Finn: The MO Factory?
BMO: Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
[Scene changes to Bad Lands, just outside the MO Co. BMO is telling Finn and Jake where to go.]
BMO: Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
Finn: Tears in the oven? [gloomy sounds] But memories are real, real cruc'[ial]!
BMO: Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
Jake: Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say... [Jake transforms into a MO.] Finn and JMO!
BMO: [laughs] Wow!
Finn: Hey BMO, check this out, too! [Finn puts his backpack on BMO's arms. He pulls his arms into his sleeves and pulls his shirt up over his head and over BMO's legs, making it seem like Finn has BMO for a head.] Meet FMO.
BMO: Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
[Scene changes to inside of the entrance of the MO factory. Finn falls over.]
Jake: Hello, there.
DMO: Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
Jake: Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
Finn: And I'm FMO!
DMO: Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
Finn: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
DMO: Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
[A hole opens in the wall beside DMO and an EMO comes out, twirling a lasso.]
Finn: Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
DMO: Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
[Finn and Jake step onto the tram. DMO is lowered from his original position, and a chair pops up on the tram, bringing up DMO to the driver seat.]
DMO: Greetings. [He starts the tram.]
Finn: Wup!
DMO: We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
Jake: But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
DMO: I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
Jake: Uh, what question?
DMO: That question- [grunts with frustration]
Jake: I'm serious...
DMO: Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
BMO: [gasps] Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
Finn: I know, I heard!
[Finn jumps off of the tram and into the room along with Jake.]
DMO: What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
[The room has outlets in the back of the wall. They each correspond to a different MO from AMO-GMO. The B port is covered up.]
Jake: Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
Finn: None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
[Outside of the room where the trams travel, a new tram drives up, carrying four SMOs.]
SMO 1: Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
[The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room. Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves.
SMO 1: Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
SMO 2: Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
SMO 1: Allllright, everyone. About face. [All four SMOs turn around.] Does anyone see the intruders now? [The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks annoyed.] Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
[Scene changes to a kind of office kitchen. There is a table with chairs, a vending machine, a refrigerator and a microwave.]
SMO 3: Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
SMO 4: Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. [SMO 4 takes his gun and gets donuts out of the vending machine with it.]
SMO 1: Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? [SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen, as if to drink it.] Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
SMO 3: [while rubbing a coffee mug on his side] Man, that goof.
SMO 1: Yeah, I hate that goof. [SMO 1 rubs the donut on his screen like he is eating it.] You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
SMO 3: Yeah, 100%.
[SMO 4 tries to throw donuts straight from the bag into his mouth, but they keep hitting the screen and falling to the floor. From somewhere in the room, the sound of feet walking gets SMO 1's attention.]
SMO 1: Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
[An SMO with an orange screen and orange legs turns around.]
SMO 5: Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
SMO 1: Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. [to the other SMOs:] So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
[The scene pans over to SMO 5. We see the inside of SMO 5, which is really just Finn, BMO, and Jake hiding inside an SMO shell. They are using Jake as the face and legs of the SMO.]
Finn: [whispering:] BMO, how are you doing?
BMO: Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! [BMO's screen shows him barfing.]
Jake: Ah, we gotta hustle!
SMO 1: [in response to something someone else said:] Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
[Inside the SMO shell, while SMO 1 is talking, Jake takes a cord from BMO and plugs it into the back of SMO 1. Suddenly, SMO 1's face is shocked and is then frozen as BMO accesses the file "MAP.MO". He starts shaking.]
SMO 4: Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
[We see inside the SMO shell again, and we see the map on BMO's screen. The map scrolls down to the bottom.]
Jake: Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
Finn: Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. [memorizing it:] Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
[They throw down SMO 1 and jump out of the shell.]
Finn: Psych! [Finn, Jake, and BMO start running away.]
SMO 3: Hey, woah!
[The three get to a metal grate.]
Finn: Down that grate!
[Jake breaks it and they go under it. We see seven SMOs after them, telling them to stop. The scene changes to below the grate. The three fall down perfectly timed with the tram, driven by DMO. They land right on top of it. They look behind them and see an SMO poking his head out of the ceiling.]
DMO: Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%! [DMO walks down to where Finn, Jake, and BMO are.] Get off of my tram!
Jake: Cram your tram! [Jake minimizes to DMO's size. He runs over and kicks DMO off of the tram.] Womp!
[Finn turns to look at him and gives smiles at him, raising his fists in the air. Jake pulls a lever by the driver's seat, making them go even faster. Finn laughs and looks down at BMO.]
Finn: Hang in there, BMO!
[BMO flashes a weak thumbs up on his screen.]
Finn: Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
[Finn is interrupted by an explosion behind him. He and BMO are thrown to the front of the tram.]
Finn: Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
[Behind them, a tram with ten SMOs and DMO is following them.]
DMO: Hit 'em again!
[The SMOs shoot the tram. Almost half of the tram is gone.]
Finn: Holy-
Jake: Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
Finn: Uh, turn right!
[Jake turns the tram right. The SMOs tram continues forward, but using a shortcut, they get behind them again.]
Finn: Dog it, they're still behind us! ["They drive through a 2D DNA-like path. Unlike a strand of DNA, there is only one looping part. Finn and Jake are driving in a straight line down the middle of the 'DNA' as the SMOs tram loops around them.]
Finn: Turn left!
[They drive through a road beneath another. The SMO's tram goes on the top road.]
Finn: Turn Corkscrew!
[They now drive in a 3D DNA-like path. This time, there is two curves. The two trams loop around each other. Eventually, they merge into one track.]
Finn: Now go down!
[Jake makes the tram face completely downward. Finn, Jake, and BMO fall off. Jake stretches into a shield below them. They break through three different floors. One room has a B port, but they fall too quickly.]
Finn: There's a driver port!
[In the last room they fall through, Jake turns into a parachute. They land on the floor of a huge, white room. Finn and Jake groan with their pains from falling.]
Finn: Too spicy.
Jake: My bod!
[Behind them, ten SMOs and DMO from the tram fall through the ceiling, crashing on top of one another.]
SMO 6: Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
BMO: [weakly:] I am not non-MO.
[SMO 6 still charges his laser gun]
BMO: [louder:] I am BMO!
[SMO 6 shoots his laser at the ceiling so he doesn't shoot anybody.]
SMO 6: [whispering, in awe:] BMO.
[A light flashes in the faces of the SMOs.]
Moe: BMO? Did I hear BMO?
Jake: Wait, what's up?
[We see the lights are coming from a room with MMO and Moe. MMO takes Moe out of his chair and cradles him. MMO carries him down to where Finn, Jake, the SMOs and where DMO is, with little unknown MOs trailing behind, holding life support equipment and tools]
Moe: Hey, I'm Moe! [Moe taps MMO twice on the head. MMO drops him. Moe laughs.] Don't worry! My legs don't work!
Finn: You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
Moe: My skin is human!
Jake: Dude, how old are you?!
Moe: Hey, come on, now! [Moe crawls over to where BMO is. He turns him so BMO is sitting down.] It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems! [Moe turns BMO off. He opens his face plate. He looks at the inside of him with a frown.] Hmm.
Finn: So...you made BMO?
Jake: [Jake stretches to a large size.] Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
Moe: Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. [A CMO brings over a screwdriver.] Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad. [Moe chuckles.] I sent BMO off into the world alone. [Moe coughs a couple of times while saying:] Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
Finn: Aw.
Moe: Oh, there's that back-up driver disk! [A CMO is holding a small floppy disk.] Thank you. [The CMO gives him the OK sign and smiles.] [Moe puts the disk drive into a slot in BMO. Some lights flash. The system shoots the disk back out.] That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play. [extends an arm and something makes a cracking sound] You see, I made BMO to be more. [Moe turns BMO on.]
BMO: Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
Moe: Nah, I'm just your poop.
[BMO gasps and runs up to Moe to give him a hug.]
Jake: Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
Finn: Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
Moe: Ah, those were just the surface jerks. [to MMO:] Up, please. [MMO lifts him up over himself. He carries him over to a porthole in the ground with a wheel.] Kid, come over here. [He turns the wheel and the scene shows what's inside. There are a couple hundred MOs milling about. We see a QMO watering plants, an unknown MO with wings, two LMOs throwing dice and money, two CMOs playing jump rope with an OMO while a WMO, PMO, and three ♥MOs looking at them.] BMO, say hello to your family.
BMO: Hello, family.
[All of the MOs turn up to look at him.]
MOs: Hi, BMO!
[BMO puts his hands on his smiling face.]
[The episode begins with Finn and Jake fighting a group of Slider Guys. Finn ineffectually swats at a couple with what is left of his Demon Blood Sword while Jake punches and kicks them away.]
Finn: Thanks, bro!
Jake: There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently.
Finn: [concerned] Okay. What is it, bro?
Jake: Get a new sword.
Finn: What you do mean?
Jake: Bro, these guys could've hurt you.
Finn: It still works. [swings it] Hyut!
Jake: Bro...
Finn: I love this sword. [hugs it]
Jake: It'll be okay. Let's go shopping!
[The scene switches to a marketplace, where several townspeople are selling their goods.]
Suzy & Sue: Candles! Candles! Candles for all occasions!
Jake: Hey! There's Choose Goose! [looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly] Goose! Come on! [realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him] Finn? What's wrong?
Finn: Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
Jake: What? But we have history with him—that's important in business.
Finn: Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? [motions his hands in the shape of an hourglass]
Jake: [winces] Ooh. Yeah, okay.
[The two walk on.]
Jake: I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. [motions to a grass tipi in front of them]
Finn: Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
[The tipi opens, revealing an "OPEN" sign.]
Finn & Jake: Open! [They walk inside.]
Voice: Close the curtains behind you, please.
[Finn does so.]
Voice: Walk towards the candle.
[They approach the man at the counter, who is wearing sunglasses and a cloak.]
Man: How can I help you?
Finn: Need a sword.
Man: Hold on. [brings out a sword] Here you go: a grass sword. It's a bargain.
Finn: I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
Man: Swords like this don't come around every day.
Finn: Don't come around every day, uh? [wields the sword] I love it.
Jake: Well, that was easy.
Man: [as Finn and Jake walk out] Remember, no take backs.
[Finn practices with the sword as a townsperson pushes up a cart loaded with pillows.]
Jake: Hey, the pillow vendor!
[The scene changes to Finn and Jake walking through the woods. Jake is carrying a pillow while Finn is practicing with his sword. Suddenly, a pizza flies out of the bushes.]
Finn: Huh? Hyut! [slices it in half]
Jake: Huh? Pizza?!
Finn: Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
Jake: You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.
Finn: No more pizza bonks. Hyut! [swishes the sword] Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
Jake: Pie!
[They approach Tree Trunks' house.]
Finn: [swishing sword] Hyut! Hyut!
[They walk inside]
Finn: Hyaaaah!♪
Tree Trunks: Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? [rolls an apple toward him]
Finn: Hyut! [slices apple perfectly]
Tree Trunks: Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.
Jake: He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.
Tree Trunks: That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!
Finn & Jake: [laugh]
Jake: I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.
[The scene changes to inside Finn and Jake's bedroom. Finn is practicing with his sword while wearing pajamas and Jake is making his bed.]
Jake: Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? [laughs]
Finn: No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell. [stabs at the air] Hyah!
Jake: Well, okay. [tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth] Dang tag.
Finn: I got it!
Jake: Hmm?
[Finn quickly slices at the tag with his sword. The tag falls apart as it is revealed that the sword cut it in the shape of Finn's face.]
Jake: [gasps]
Finn: Whoa!
Jake: Hey, quit showin' off, bro!
Finn: Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away.
Jake: Good idea. [puts the pillow in his bed, gets on top of it, and starts sleeping]
[Finn puts the sword in a chest. The scene switches to him in bed, moaning softly in his sleep. In his dream, the sword emerges from the grassy field, dissipates, and reforms in his hand. The sword wiggles, and grass starts spreading over Finn's body. Finn screams but is muffled by the grass. His whole body becomes like topiary, then blows away in the wind. Finn wakes up.]
Finn: [screams] [pants] Huh? [unzips sleeping bag, finding the sword in his hand]
[The sword extends grass from the hilt onto Finn's wrist, wrapping itself around his arm.]
Finn: What the—? [pants frantically]
[He runs outside and shrieks, swinging the sword around in an attempt to get it off. He runs into the forest and bites some of it off, but it grows back. He covers his left hand with his pajamas and manages to pull it off his right hand.]
Finn: [sighs] Jeez.
[The sword extends its grassy hands toward him, trying to reattach itself. Finn drops it and kicks it toward a cliff.]
Finn: Stupid... [kicks it] thing! [It falls into the river below.] Worst three bucks I've ever spent.
[The scene changes back to Finn in his bed. He suddenly wakes up.]
Finn: [gasps] [looks at his arm, seeing no sword] Whew.
[In the bathroom, he brushes his teeth and opens the cabinet for some floss. As he closes it, he sees the sword behind him in the mirror, still dripping wet.]
Finn: [shrieks]
Jake: What's goin' on?
Finn: The sword is after my flesh!
Jake: Huh?
[The sword wiggles its appendages.]
Jake: Oh, snap!
Finn: Don't let it get me, Jake!
Jake: Don't worry. I'll handle this. [wraps his apron around the sword's hilt and sheathes it in a baguette] There.
Finn: [sighs] Let's go return that junk.
[At the marketplace, the place where the grass tipi was is now a patch of dirt with a "FOR RENT" sign in the middle.]
Jake: Huh. Hey, he's not here.
Finn: Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
[They hear screams for help from offscreen.]
Finn: Somebody in trouble!
[They run toward the source of the cries.]
Suzy & Sue: Help! They're taking our candles!
Jake: It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!
Finn: Let's get 'em! [drops his pack and sword] Hey!
Hooligans carrying candle: Huh?
[Finn kicks the candle out of their grip.]
Hooligan: Yo! You got a prob, Bob?
Finn: Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral! [punches them] [kicks another in the face]
Another hooligan: Anarchy! [throws candle at Finn]
Finn: [catches it and throws it back] School! [kicks him] Hyah!
[Jake runs by chasing two more hooligans.]
Hooligans: Aah! Stop chasing us!
[Finn continues fighting, then rests, panting. A hooligan holding a candle comes up from behind.]
Hooligan: Happy birthday. [bashes Finn's head with candle]
[Finn falls to the ground and holds his head. He looks up to see five of the hooligans upon him.]
Hooligan: [brandishing candle] You're dead, teddy boy.
[Finn looks down to see the sword wrapped around his wrist again.]
Finn: No.
[The hooligan lifts the candle above his head in slow motion, coming in for another hit, but Finn quickly gets up and slices at the candle multiple times. The candle falls apart in the shape of Finn's face. While the hooligans are taken aback, Finn leaps over them while slicing at their hair. After he lands, their hair falls off and they run away screaming.]
Suzy & Sue: You've saved our shop!
Sue: Thank you so much, you brave young man.
Suzy: And don't even worry about the damages.
Sue: We'll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness.
Suzy: Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot—the candle man!
[The sword grips Finn's wrist tightly.]
Jake: Dude... [winces]
Finn: Yeah... not comin' off.
Jake: Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
[The scene changes to them walking up to Choose Goose's stall.]
Jake: Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
Choose Goose: I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers—Why should I?
Jake: What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
Choose Goose: Hmm.
[Finn slices at a fly, but knocks down some of Choose Goose's wares.]
Finn: I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective. [earnestly] Please.
Choose Goose: Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.
Jake: Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.
Finn: Yeah, thanks!
[Finn and Jake start walking off.]
Choose Goose: [shouting after them] He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...
[Finn and Jake stop in their tracks and turn around.]
Choose Goose: He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.
[The scene switches to Finn and Jake running toward the grassy mountain. Suddenly, some grass monsters emerge from the side of the hill. Finn slices the head off each one as he runs by.]
Finn: Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
[In front of them, a giant Grass Bear grows out of the ground. It growls and spits at them and steps toward Jake.]
Jake: [screams]
[Finn gets Jake out of the way of the monster's foot and slices its leg in the shape of his face without even looking. The monster howls while balancing on one foot. Finn flicks the blade of his sword, causing it to rapidly spin like a propeller. The monster spits at them some more, then collapses on top of them. Finn uses the sword to blast his way out from under the mound of grass. The blade stops spinning and they continue up the mountain.]
Finn: Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
[They reach the shack at the top of the mountain.]
Finn: Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
[The door opens and out steps the guy who sold Finn his sword. He casts aside his cloak and sunglasses.]
Grassy Wizard: Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?! [uses his powers to bring out his household objects made of grass] Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! [sends them flying through the air toward Finn and Jake]
Finn: Hyah! [slices all the objects while running toward the wizard]
Grassy Wizard: Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth. [looks inside his house] That was all my grassy objects.
[Finn lands in front of him, knocking the wizard backwards.]
Finn: [points his sword at the wizard] Lift the curse.
Grassy Wizard: [laughs] Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! [laughs]
Finn: [contemplates for a moment] Hmm. You know what? [backs off from wizard] I think I'm cool with that.
[The sword retracts and wraps around Finn's arm.]
Grassy Wizard: What?
Finn: Whoa. [laughs] [extends and retracts his sword a few times]
Jake: Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!
Finn: [extends it] Yeah. [retracts it] This is really cool! [extends it] I just had to get used to it. [retracts it]
Grassy Wizard: That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!
Finn & Jake: Whatevs.
[They run down the mountain while Finn retracts and extends his sword.]
Jake: [laughs] Do it again! [laughs]
Finn: Get it, get it!
[A ladybug hisses at him]
Finn: [Jumps with a sword.] Yah!
Jake: [Jumps with a lion-shape shield.] Oooooooh!
[They land on the ground and Finn raises his sword with light blasting out of it. He runs up to the ladybug and chops the ground in front of it. The lady bug climbs onto his sword.]
Jake: Get him out!
[Finn goes outside.]
Finn: Don't you ever let me catch you here again!
[Finn puts the ladybug in the grass and goes inside.]
Finn: Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha! [Closes the door] Agh! Ow! [Zooms in to a little splinter] Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh!
Jake: Did he get you with his poison stingers?
Finn: No, I got a splinter from the door.
Jake: Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.
Finn: But it hurts! I'm gonna need some... [Flashes to a different scene with a thimble on Finn's finger] ...finger protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.
Choose Goose: I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn: Man, I am so protected right now!
[Finn and Jake hear knights talking.]
Knight 1: That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! [Another knight hits him with a sword and it breaks in half. They clap. Knight 2 makes an okay sign with his fingers and the other knights cheer.]
Finn: Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me! [Jake punches Finn on the arm] Oww! [Holding his arm] On my armor!
Jake: Oh. [Punches thimble]
Finn: [Makes an okay sign with his fingers] Click-click!
[Knights begin to laugh.]
Knight 1: That is but a thimble! This [Hits his armor twice] is real armor! [They all laugh again but Sir Slicer shows up on his horse with birds calling and flying everywhere.]
Finn & Jake: Wha?
All Knights: Sir Slicer! [All bow]
Sir Slicer: Who is the one that bears the thimble?
Jake: This dude. [Points at Finn]
Sir Slicer: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah! [Rides on his horse away and Finn and Jake run to Choose Goose.]
Finn: Choose Goose, I need more armor.
Choose Goose: I've got something for you --[Holds up metal shoe] a metal shoe! Don't ya know you might stub your toe?
[Knights laughing at it.]
Finn: Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need...
Choose Goose: Look here hun. Choose this one to protect your buns [Holds up armor shorts with big butt cheeks in back]!
[Knights laughing]
One knight: Protect his butt! Protect his butt!
Finn: [Cheeks turn more red] No, Choose Goose. I want--
Choose Goose: Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek?
[Knights continue to laugh]
One knight: Look at his butt! [Falls over] Look at his butt!
[Choose Goose cackles.]
Finn: [Smacks Choose Goose in the face] Choose Goose, I want the most [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click armor you have!
Choose Goose: Ooh, have a look! [Points at the armors with his foot]
Finn: [Sees one with a skull on the front golden all around that a silver hat with a golden horseshoe on the top red sleeves black over the sleeves and golden things on the side of the hat.] I'll take that one! [Eyes glow]
Choose Goose: [Gets the armor Finn wants] Wonderful! I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend!
Jake: Say what?
Finn: No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!
Choose Goose: No money for me? How about a poem for free?
[Knights laugh some more on the ground and one falls over]
Finn: [Looks at the knights and, cheeks turning red, looks back at Choose Goose] A poem?
Choose Goose: If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron. It is foretold to be totally [makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click!
Finn & Jake: Skadow!
Choose Goose: [Hands Finn the poem] Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill.
Finn: Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
Jake: Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! [Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer: Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! [Goes away on his horse]
Finn: Ja! [Cuts to another scene] He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!
Jake: Yeah, what a bumbleberry!
Finn & Jake: Whoa! [Comes to a place with lot of curtains]
Jake: What's the poem say?
Finn: "The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down." I don't get it...
Jake: [Feels the poem] Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.
Finn: How'd you understand that?
Jake: You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to [feels it] feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!
Finn: You're not coming?
Jake: No way, man. This armor thing is your deal! [Jake stretches over] I'll wait for you on the other side.
Finn: [starts walking in the swamp] This place will be a piece of... [moves a curtain and sees an old lady taking a shower]
Old Lady: Aah!
Finn: Aaaaah!!![face turns red] Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry! [covers his face closes that curtain and opens another curtain, sees another old lady taking a shower] Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Old Lady: Oh, no! [An old guy walks in]
Old Guy: [drops his soap when he sees Finn] My most private parts peeped by a boy!
Finn: Huuuh!!! [Closes that one and opens another curtain and sees a mom giving a baby a shower]
The Mom: Aah! Pervert!
Finn: I'm not a pervert! [face turns more red]
The Mom: You should be ashamed of yourself!
Finn: I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [his whole face turns red and goes through lots of other curtains and finally gets to Jake. Finn breathes hard] Aah!
Man: My privates!
Finn: I'm sorry!
Man 2: My privates!
Finn: I'm sorry!
Jake: You okay, man?
Finn: No! [Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer: Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn & Jake: Wha?!
Sir Slicer: What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment? [Camera turns to Finn] You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! [Sir Slicer leaves on his horse]
Finn: Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?
Jake: [feels the poem] Hmm... Ooh! "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come."
Finn: What does that even mean?!
Jake: It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. [they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was]
Finn & Jake: Huh! [They see a Red-faced Monster crying]
Finn: Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that!
Jake: All right, I'll handle this one, dude.
Finn: No. This is my burden.
Jake: Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.
Finn: [Walks up to the animal] Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!
The Animal: Huh?
Finn: Stop crying because that's what you want to do!
The Animal: Hu ha huh? [picks Finn up and smiles]
Finn: Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! [The monster pictures Finn as her baby]
The Animal: Oho... [cradling Finn back and forth]
Jake: Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude!
Finn: Noo!!!
The Animal: Aaa! Ooh! Mmm! [then Sir Slicer shows up]
Jake: Huh?
Sir Slicer: Minstrel? [A lyre player comes out and sings "Finn the Blushing Baby"]
Minstrel: "He's Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red! / Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed!"
Sir Slicer: Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come.
Finn: Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! [The monster tries to chop Sir Slicer but he puts up his arm which had armor and hurt the monster's hand]
The Animal: Oh!
Sir Slicer: Armor, [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click. [He leaves on his horse]
Finn: Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!
Jake: Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo! [Just then, a shadow cast over Jake] Uh, Finn? Uh-oh. [the monster laid on Jake to take a nap]
Finn: Jake? You okay? Huh? [just then Jake's arm came out of the fur on the animal right in front of Finn and came out the fur on the animals back]
Finn & Jake: Yeah!
Finn: Awesome!
Jake: Yeah!
Finn & Jake: Whoa! [They came to a door that says "Home of Zeldron's Armor"]
Finn: Finally! [kicks the door open] Yah! [A ghost appears]
Ghost Man: Hello!
Finn: Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!
Ghost Man: First, you have to beat my high score in a game of Drop Ball [throwing the ball in the air]
Finn & Jake: Drop Ball?
Ghost Man: Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya. [He throws the ball under him, bends down, and picks it up with his butt] Hut! One point. [Finn's face turns red] Two points. Three points.
Finn: This game looks awful.
Ghost Man: Oh, no. I absolutely disagree!
Finn: [to Jake] Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.
Jake: How? He's already dead.
Ghost Man: Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six!
Finn: Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. [He throws the ball under Finn, he put his arms on the ground and tries but couldn't go that low]
Ghost Man: No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it! [He bends his knees and picks it up] See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. [Finn and Jake go to the next room while his back is turned]
Finn & Jake: Whoa! [they see a big shiny light]
Jake: Finn, its so beautiful!
Finn: Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. [Then orbs of the light come out]
Orb: Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it. [The light struck Finn putting him in the air] Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. [Then the light put it on Finn]
Finn: Huh?! Aah!! [Which he found out it was a woman's armor] No! Dude, this is lady armor!
Jake: [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click!
Orb: [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click!
Finn: No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment! [He takes it off] I don't need armor!
Ghost Man: [Kicks door open] You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique!
Finn & Jake: Huh?
Ghost Man: I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that! [turns in to a monster-like creature] Raarg!
Finn: Now what?
Jake: Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!
Finn: Never! Yaaaaaaah! [Finn runs up to the monster ghost, tries to punch him but goes through him]
Monster Ghost: [Picks Finn up and starts to take his soul]
Jake: Hey!
Monster Ghost: Huh?
[Camera moves to Jake, wearing the Armor of Zeldron]
Monster Ghost: Mama?
Jake: Uhh... Yeah! [In a high pitched voice] Listen when your mother is speaking to you!
Monster Ghost: Yes, Mama.
Jake: [High pitched voice] You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight!
Monster Ghost: But I...
Jake: [High pitched voice and is pointing] No back talk! Outside! Now!
Monster Ghost: [Puts Finn down and the monster ghost goes outside, burns from sunlight and then turns back to a normal person]
Finn: Whoa.
Person: Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball!
Jake: [normal voice] No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without [pointing up] the power of embarrassment!
Finn: And I learned I don't need armor to be -- [Sir Slicer shows up]
Sir Slicer: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click!
Finn: Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude!
Person and Jake: Ha ha ha ha
Jake: Good one, Finn.
Person: Yeah ha ha.
Sir Slicer: Well, I've... just been in the same areas today.
Person & Jake: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Person: Yeah, right!
Jake: Whatever!
Sir Slicer: Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!
Finn: Come over here and say that to my fist!
Sir Slicer: Okay, I will! [Gets down from his horse, falls down and lands on side] Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. [Grabs a stick] Aghhh! Splinter!
Finn: Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this! [He holds up the thimble] Here you go! [Throws it at Sir Slicer's face]
Sir Slicer: Oh!
Finn: Free of charge!
Jake: [Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back] Come on, dude, let's get out of here.
Finn: Ha ha! [Cheeks turn red] Okay, buddy.
Jake: [Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor] Wa-hoo! [Flies over the 3 mountain tops, breaking them] Dude, this armor is totally Click-click!
[The episode starts when Finn finishes building Flame Princess' new house, which Flame Princess loves.]
Finn: Well, looks like your new house is done. [Throws helmet] Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?
Jake: Naah, [Draws Lady Rainicorn on the dirt] don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.
Flame Princess: [Excited] I wanna see inside! [Checks inside the house and merging with it] [Laughter] I love it! [deep voice]
Finn: Great! [Fire touches Finn] [Quick sigh] This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to. [Fire spreads throughout Finn's right leg] [Then panics] Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob! [Dives into the nearby river]
Jake: [Worried] Finn!
[Finn rises above the surface]
Finn: Haha, I'm okay!
Flame Princess: [Interested] Hmmmm...
Finn: [Laughter and splashes]
Flame Princess: Oh! [Requests] Do the thing that I like.
Finn: [Agrees and acts] [Sucking some water and squirts it upward like a sprinkler]
Flame Princess: [Giggles]
Jake: [Requests] Now do the thing I like.
Finn: [Agrees, acts and turns around, where his butt is facing] [Submerges, splashes and farts underwater gas bubbles for three times]
Jake: Hehehe, classic. [Stretches out his left hand to Finn] Alright Finn, that's enough. [Pulls Finn out of the water]
[Then Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form.]
Flame Princess: Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.
Finn: [Eyes sparkle] You... wanna hug?
Flame Princess: Yes.
[Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other and Jake interrupts for a moment.]
Jake: Woah! Hold on "mama."
[Then moments later, Jake wraps Finn with FOILED AGAIN tin foil like a burrito.]
Jake: [Pats the foil] Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.
[Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other again and blushed from back to front.] [Then Flame Princess hugs Finn and her flames become a little stronger.]
Jake: [Weird smile]
[Hug ends]
Finn: Bye.
Flame Princess: [Whispers] Bye, Finn.
[Then Finn and Jake leaves]
Finn: [Turns around] Bye! [Loses some balance]
Flame Princess: [Giggles and waves Good Bye at Finn.]
[Moments later]
Jake: Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.
Finn: Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
Jake: Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look [Turns right arm to 15 small stairsteps], let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, [Points left finger to first step], you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, [Points left finger to second step] you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road [points left finger to fifth step], you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 [points left finger to eighth step], where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
Finn: [Very curious] [Pops out his left arm and points left finger to fifteenth step] What about Tier 15?
Jake: [Warns Finn while pointing his left finger at him] You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!
Finn: [Terrified] Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
Jake: [Undoes the 15 small stairsteps] Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.
Finn: What?! [Pops out right arm] [Rips a bit of tinfoil] [Then sniffs self] Oh gross.
[Later, near the Tree Fort]
Finn: Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
[At the front door]
Jake: Probably.
Finn: Crup.
[Jake opens the front door]
Princess Bubblegum: 'Sup, guys?
Finn and Jake: Princess Bubblegum?!
Jake: What are you doing here?
Princess Bubblegum: Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.
Jake: Oh.
Finn: I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
Princess Bubblegum: What? Why?
Finn: Just don't. [Flips to the ladder and climbs up quickly] Hyap!
Princess Bubblegum: What's that all about?
Jake: Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.
Princess Bubblegum: [Curious and interested] Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.
Jake: Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.
Princess Bubblegum: [Sits on the floor to hear better] Oh, come on, you can tell me.
Jake: That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.
Princess Bubblegum: Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.
[Suddenly Jake reveals in an outburst]
Jake: Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!
Princess Bubblegum: [Distraught] What?!
Jake: And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon, [lowers voice] they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.
Princess Bubblegum: No, this isn't possible.
Jake: Oh, it's possible.
Princess Bubblegum: I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.
[Moments later, outside the Tree Fort]
Princess Bubblegum: Morrow!
Morrow: [Picks up Princess Bubblegum]
[Inside the Tree Fort]
Jake: [Confused] Mmm, weird.
BMO: [Climbs down the ladder] Guess who's late for their video chat. [Opens the video chat and President Porpoise appears]
Jake: [Gasps] President Porpoise!
President Porpoise: [Dolphin sounds]
[Later at Princess Bubblegum's bedroom]
Princess Bubblegum: [Opens the door quickly and runs to her bed] No, no. [Gets her diary at the back of her pillow and writes down: FINN + LOVE + FLAME PRINCESS] Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.
[The next day]
[Jake pulls out the contents out of the sack which was Princess Bubblegum's taxes to collect]
Finn: Yyyaawn! [Finn slides down the ladder, then jumps over Jake] Whoop. Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess, be back later. [Panting while running towards the door and then he opens it.]
[Suddenly Princess Bubblegum was standing in the doorway]
Princess Bubblegum: Finn!
Finn: [Shrieks like a girl]
Jake: Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.
Princess Bubblegum: I have something important to tell you. About relationships.
Finn: Ah, that's okay, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum: I just hope, you'll understand. [Picks a crystal from her purse, then drops it to the floor and suddenly a holo-screen appears. Next she moves the contents of the holo-screen] Relationships [drops her purse] are like layers of sedimentary rock.......
Finn: Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
Jake: Uh, ok, [lowers voice] Tier 2 baby!
Finn: Word. [Then flips out of the Tree Fort's front door]
[Jake turns around and sees more boring stuff.]
Princess Bubblegum: If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......
[Then Jake falls asleep and starts daydreaming]
Jake: What? Where am I?
Mini-snowman: Jake, you're president now!
[The Mini-snowman and the other 2 animals clap for Jake being the new president.]
Jake: Oh my glosh! [Starts dancing]
[Princess Bubblegum tries to wake up Jake]
Princess Bubblegum: Jake!
Jake: [Groans for 3 times]
Princess Bubblegum: Wake up!
Jake: [Groans another and regains consciousness]
Princess Bubblegum: Jake, where's Finn?
Jake: He stepped out.
Princess Bubblegum: Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?
Jake: Oh, oh! [Thinking Princess Bubblegum is jealous] I see what's going on here!
Princess Bubblegum: Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. [Then leaves the Tree Fort]
Jake: Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!
[Several hours later, Finn returns home.]
[Moments later, inside the Tree Fort, Jake is playing with BMO]
BMO: Jump, punch, kick, kick!
Jake: What's up man?
Finn: Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
Jake: She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!
Finn: [Suddenly frowns]
Jake: So, you at Tier 2 yet?
Finn: [Recalls] I got about five hugs, does that count?
Jake: Nnoope.
Finn: [Embarrassed] Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
Jake: I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem." [Takes Finn to the bedroom]
[Moments later, at their bedroom]
Jake: Say something about her "spectrum."
Finn: Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it! [Checks Jake]
Jake: [Snoring while sleeping]
[Then the sun rises and Finn looks at it for an idea.]
[Later outside, Finn sits near a tree facing the rising sun making a poem]
Finn: Inspiration... [Then writes again, thinks, rips out another paper, and starts writing again.]
[Princess Bubblegum suddenly appears nearby]
Princess Bubblegum: Finn!
Finn: [Shrieks like a girl]
Princess Bubblegum: Whatcha doin'?
Finn: Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
Finn: Yyeah.
Princess Bubblegum: And you understand?
Finn: [Turns around] Yeah, I understand.
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, sometimes you want someone and you [puts hand on Finn's left knee] want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
Finn: [Finn is angered, blushing and he retaliates] What are you trying to say?!
Princess Bubblegum: I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
Finn: [Still angered, stands up for himself and Flame Princess] Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
Princess Bubblegum: What?
Finn: Now you like me?!
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn: What am I talking about?! [Sighs and assumes] PB, I was.... geh...eh.. [Blushes] I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. [Leaves Princess Bubblegum for herself]
Princess Bubblegum: [Picks up a piece of crumpled paper and tries reading it, then quietly exclaims] Oh, no!
[Later at the Tree Fort, Jake is making and singing "Bacon Pancakes"]
[Then Princess Bubblegum appears climbing up a ladder.]
Princess Bubblegum: Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
Jake: [Taps the frying pan] Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz."
Princess Bubblegum: Is he with her?! [Shows the crumpled paper to Jake] Or not?!
Jake: [Jake is angered and he retaliates] You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off! [Picks up PANCAKE TOWER box] You should be [throws box to Princess Bubblegum] ashamed! [Princess Bubblegum dodges the box] You're SICK! [Points and blames Princess Bubblegum for everything]
Princess Bubblegum: What are you..? This isn't about some [crumbles the paper] petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! [Explains] Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
Jake: [Shocked and Gasps]
Princess Bubblegum: Will you take me to them?
[Jake turns around, shuts the burner, grabs Princess Bubblegum, grows huge, breaks the wall, and makes a run for it.]
Princess Bubblegum: Faster!
[Later, near Flame Princess's house]
Finn: [Blushing while reciting his poem for Flame Princess.] Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. [Then the poem is accidentally burnt by Flame Princess.]
Finn and Flame Princess: [Both giggle]
Flame Princess: Ahhh.
[Then Finn and Flame Princess lean in to kiss each other.]
Princess Bubblegum: No!
[Finn and Flame Princess kiss for the very first time, followed by a bright light from the instability of Flame Princess's elemental matrix, which throws Finn to the ground.]
Finn: [In pain, with serious burns around the lips] Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! [Crawls to the melted hole]
[Flame Princess continues to melt and fall through the Earth's crust.]
Finn: FLAME PRINCESS!
Jake: [Panting] Finn!
Princess Bubblegum: Finn, there's no time! You have to...
Jake: Are you alright?
[Finn grabs Jake's right arm, ties it around himself, and jumps into the hole after Flame Princess.]
Princess Bubblegum: Finn!
Jake: [Difficulty of handling Finn keeps increasing. He slips and covers the entire hole.]
Finn: [Panting, then he hits ground. The surrounding scene color changes from red to violet.] Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
Jake: [In pain] It's hot!
Princess Bubblegum: Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. [Hushed voice] She'll go out.
Jake: [Still in pain] Geh.. What about Finn?
[At the bottom of the hole]
Finn: Hey! [Struggling to breathe] What's wrong? Please, say something. [Breathes twice] Please... [breathes] I need you... [breathes] to be okay. [Takes a deep breath and gives Flame Princess air to save her.]
[Flame Princess burns again and regains consciousness.]
[Finn loses consciousness, with added burns to the right side of his face.]
Flame Princess: Huh, ummm. [Gasps]
[Jake pulls out both Finn and Flame Princess successfully.]
Finn: [Coughs] Are you okay?
Flame Princess: I'm okay. I'm okay.
[Princess Bubblegum struggles to get out of Jake's weight and gets a relief.]
Princess Bubblegum: [Sighs] She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.
[Then Finn discovers another way of kissing Flame Princess without getting hurt.]
Finn: [Blushes] [Kisses a rock.]
Flame Princess: [Blushes] [Kisses the same rock, which smolders slightly.]
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, Finn.
Jake: [Coughs]
[She turns around and sees Jake staring at her with a grin.]
Princess Bubblegum: [Unhappy] What?
Jake: [Weird smile] Jeeeaalous?
Princess Bubblegum: Shut up.
[Episode begin with Jake using his stretched legs to move through the Stock Woods.]
Jake: You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams.
[Finn comes behind Jake, walking on all fours, using shovels for stilts.]
Finn: Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh!
Jake: Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?
Finn: I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go?
[Jake has shrunk down and stretches his leg to trip Finn's stilts]
Jake: Heh heh heh.
Finn: [falling] Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought.
[They both laugh.]
Jake: Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out!
Finn: Whoa!
Jake: Looks like a giant dead turtle.
Finn: I think it's some kind of city of...
Hag: [Moving out of her camouflage] Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves! [laughs] Even you.
Finn: I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy.
Jake: Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. [Penny is shown crying.]
Finn: [running to Penny] Oh, whoa!
Hag: Be warned!
Finn: Enough lady! [to Penny] Hey little girl, are you okay?
Penny: [falling back] Please, don't steal anything from me!
Finn: Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes.
Jake: [stretching his stomach to look like a face] We want to turn your frown all the way around. [twisting the face he made on his stomach]
Penny: Ahh! [continues crying]
Finn: [nudging him] Jake!
Jake: I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this.
Finn: So what's wrong?
Penny: Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city.
Finn: The city?
Hag: ...of Thieves!
Jake: Oh boy.
Hag: Heed my warning boy: enter the city, and you'll come out a thief!
Finn: Never. [takes Penny on his shoulders] I'll get this girl's flowers back-
Penny: My name is Penny.
Finn: I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake!
Jake: Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!
[Scene switches to inside the City of Thieves.]
Finn: Cool.
Jake: Crud.
[Short Goblin runs by and steals the Big Guy's ring]
Big Guy: My ring!
Finn: [gasps along with Jake] Stop thief!
[The Short Goblin runs away while the Big Guy breaks through his house's wall and steals the Skeleton Baby from the Skeleton Mom.]
Finn: Stop!
[Skeleton Baby steals the ruby from Big Guy's tooth.]
Big Guy: My ruby!
Finn: Stop, baby! Don't steal!
[Skeleton Baby runs into Mr. Turtle. She falls over and the ruby is thrown into Mr. Turtle's hands.]
Finn: Don't steal, Mr. Turtle!
Penny: Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous!
Finn: Penny! Never say that!
Penny: Redoodoodiculous?
Finn: No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going to [yells] beat my purity into them!
Jake: And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them. [lightly punches Finn] And then beat a sandwich into them! [grunts while throwing air punches] And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em!
Finn: We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket!
Jake: Okay.
[Finn and Jake start running towards Mr. Turtle.]
Finn: Hey turd-le (turtle)! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?
Jake: You're going down, turtle!
[Mr. Turtle flies off by using fires coming out of him.]
Jake: Woah! I want jets!
[Mr. Turtle lands on a roof and Crossbow Guy steals the jewel from his crown.]
Finn: Come back, Crossbow Guy!
[Finn punches Mr. Turtle. When Crossbow Guy lands, Two-Headed Thief steals his crossbow.]
Crossbow Guy: My crossbow!
Penny: Hey, my basket! That's my basket!
Finn: Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy! [points to Crossbow Guy.] Stealing's wrong, doofus!
[Crossbow Guy drops the jewel from Mr. Turtle's crown.]
Penny: [laughs] This is fun, Finn!
[Finn whoops. Finn, Jake, and Penny fly off after the Two-Headed Thief. Wizard Thief is shown cutting off one of Two-Headed Thief's heads and stealing Penny's basket.]
Two-Headed Thief Head 1: My bro!
Two-Headed Thief Head 2: My body!
[The Cyclops confronts the Wizard Thief]
Cyclops: I'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard!
[Wizard Thief casts a spell, and misses Cyclops.]
Wizard Thief: Pancake, pancake, pancake.
[Wizard Thief turns into a cat and runs away. Cyclops picks up the basket and turns it upside down.]
Two-Headed Thief Head 2: Ow, brotha'!
[Phil steals Cyclops's glasses and the flower basket.]
Cyclops: My glasses!
[Phil lands near a wall. The Rock Wall Thief steals Phil's pajamas.]
Phil: My jammies!
[Goblin Thief #1 steals the flower basket and Phil's glasses.]
Phil: My glasses!
[Jake punches Phil.]
Finn: There it goes!
[Goblin Thief #1 laughs.]
Finn: I will smite thee, goblin thief!
[Goblin Thief #1 is talking to Goblin Thief #2]
Goblin Thief #1: You stole that basket from me!
Goblin Thief #2: No I didn't! [Goblin Thief #3 steals the basket from Goblin Thief #2] Hey! Gimme that! I stole it first! I'll use my sword on you!
[Goblin Thief #1 steals Goblin Thief #2's sword.]
Goblin Thief #2: Hey! [runs off after Goblin Thief #1]
Finn: [to Goblin Thief #3] You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son! [Goblin Thief #4 steals the basket from Goblin Thief #3] Hey!
[Goblin Thieves #5 and #6 steal the basket from Goblin Thief #4 by using a fishing rod. Goblin Thief #7 steals the fishing rod from them. Goblin Thief #8 steals the fishing rod and basket from him, and Goblin Thief #9 steals the basket from Goblin Thief #8. Goblin Thief #9 runs off while Finn, Jake and Penny run after him. Suddenly, Goblin Thief #9 does not have the basket. Goblin Thief #10 has stolen it from above.]
Finn: [gasping for breath] How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! [grunts in frustration]
Jake: Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy! [Jake points to a 'Baskets & Boots' store. The owner is asleep.] He's got lots of flower baskets. And boots! I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.
Finn: No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!
Jake: [reluctantly] Okay.
Penny: I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!
Finn: That's a great idea, Penny!
Penny: There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.
Finn: Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake? [Finn turns to look at Jake, but he isn't there.] Jake?
Jake: [tiptoeing towards Baskets & Boots and whispering] Just gotta steal these boots...
Finn: Jake!
Jake: Huh?
Baskets & Boots owner: [wakes up] Hey! Go away!
Finn: What are you doin', man?
Jake: It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!
Finn: I'm here for ya buddy. [hugs Jake]
Jake: Thank you Finn, thank you.
[Jake then breaks away from Finn's arms running to the 'Baskets & Boots' store screaming.]
Finn: [running after Jake] Nooo! [tackles him] I won't let you become a thief! [puts something on Jake's hands]
Jake: Uh, what are these? [show bells tied onto his hands]
Finn: Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.
Jake: Oh. Hmm. [shakes bells]
[Scene switches to King of Thieves' tower. Finn, Penny, and Jake are walking up stairs to reach the top]
Penny: The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.
Finn: Woah. [The tower is shown surrounded by a light blue aura.] You read to pass through, Penny?
Penny: I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?
Finn: Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!
Jake: [sighs] Comin'! [Jake is wearing a pair of red boots.]
Finn: Jake, where'd you get those boots?
Jake: Huh, what? What boots? [looks down] Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!
Finn: [sighs] Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!
Jake: Yes, I can. [runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back] Oh. [chuckles]
Finn: [sighs] It's up to me, now.
Penny: Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.
Finn: Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!
Jake: She already did, man.
Finn: Oh, yeah. Right. [passes through the barrier and starts to climb the tower while Jake cheers him on. He reaches the window, only to find that there is a rope leading downward] Great, now I gotta climb down?! [floor starts to break] Huh? [The floor completely breaks and he falls down and screams, eventually hitting a spider-web at the bottom. He sees the remains of the King of Thieves.] The King of Thieves! [to the corpse] Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello? [sees a treasure chest] The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks! [A rat crawls out of the King's eye in his skull. Finn runs off screaming.]
[Scene changes to outside, where Jake and Penny are waiting.]
Jake: You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.
Finn: [exiting the tower] I got it, guys!
Penny: The chest! Gimme that! [grabs the chest from Finn]
Finn: Huh?
[Penny puts the chest down. She pulls out a black crooked knife.]
Jake: Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.
[Penny opens the chest. Inside the chest are gold coins, jewels, a dagger and a Game Boy. She laughs maniacally.]
Finn: What?! [stammering] Is you basket under all that gold?
Penny: Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!
Finn: But you're just a cute little girl!
Penny: And, I'm a thief!
Finn: Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now! [closes the lid and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back] Huh? [puts hand and body against barrier, to no avail] Why can't I...?
Penny: Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!
Finn: No! [yells] No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!
Penny: You've become a thief, stupid! [runs away with chest and laughs]
Finn: [looks at hands] My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
[Suddenly, laughing is heard. Jake looks around for the source. Underneath him, the floor rises up and the Hag emerges.]
Hag: Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are! [laughs] I was right.
Jake: Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! [puts feet around Hag's face and throws her away] [walks over to Finn] Finn?
Finn: Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.
Jake: Come on, Finn, keep it together!
Finn: No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.
Jake: I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!
Finn: Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
Jake: Cowabunga! [stretches into a cape for Finn]
Finn: Cowabunga, indeed.
[Finn and Jake start hopping over rooftops and into the house of the Short Goblin. They steal Crossbow Guy's crossbow from him and exit. They go into a different house with a crocodile in it and steal two swords. They also go into a house where a horse is showering. They steal the soap it was using and it whinnies. Scene changes to tent where Penny lives.]
Penny: [inspecting jewel from chest] Mmm. Yes. Yeah. [Finn's shadow can be seen on the tent. A twig is heard snapping.] Wha? Is someone there?! [Finn's shadow goes away and Penny returns to her inspecting. Finn and Jake's head comes down from the top of the tent and Finn quietly says "Penny," who turns around at the sound of her name. She pulls her black crooked knife out.]
Finn: [off-screen] It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you! [Jake flies over Penny, who squeals. Finn lands on the other side of the tent.]
Jake: Hi, Penny.
Penny: Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.
Finn: I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!
Penny: I'm sorry, Finn. [reaches into a nearby bag] Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some [pulls out knife] knife in your neck! [Penny jumps at Finn]
Jake: Watch out, Finn! [shoots boots at Penny, making her drop the knife and fall down]
Finn: Thanks, dude.
Jake: Yeah, dude.
Penny: You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean. [holds out soap] C'mon, Jake! [Jake laughs and throws water over Penny while Finn cleans her]
Penny: No! No! [Bubbles fill the screen and once they disappear, Finn, Jake, and Penny are all clean.]
Jake: Nice work, dude.
Finn: She's purified!
Penny: [sparkles] I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!
Finn: You're welcome.
Jake: Woah, dude! [rubs Finn, making squeaky sounds] The soap got on us, too!
Finn: We're clean!
Finn and Jake: Yes! [fist pounds]
Finn: This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! [Cherubs fly from off-screen, playing a trumpet and a harp. They steal the swords from Finn that he stole earlier.]
Penny: Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.
Finn: And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! [winks]
Penny: Never again.
Finn: Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.
Penny: [jumps up and gives Finn a hug] I'm going to miss you, Finn!
Finn: I'll miss you, too.
Penny: [exiting the tent] G'bye!
Jake: Woah, dude. Why are you naked? [Finn is shown wearing nothing but his pack and underpants.]
Finn: [gasps in shock] PENNY!
[The episode opens at night. Finn is battling monsters with a golden sword in a Minecraft-style world.]
Finn: You sad mobs. Y'all wish you had this sweet dang bucket! [A skeleton shoots the bucket Finn is holding and he gasps before charging towards the monsters.] Yaaaah! [He slays a spider and his sword breaks.] Aah! It's mine time! [He pulls a pickaxe out of his backpack and uses it to slay a skeleton.] Get beat dead-meat! [The pickaxe also breaks while he is using it to attack a zombie.] My tool! Die! [He slays the zombie using the bucket, and it drops a carrot.] Oh, a li'l zombie carrot. [He puts the carrot in his mouth and speaks with his mouth full.] I should've washed it.
[Finn walks to a stream and collects some water in the bucket, which he places full into his backpack. A sheep splashes down a nearby waterfall and bleats. Finn towers up a cliff using dirt blocks. The sun rises behind him and monsters burn away in the distance. Finn inhales and exhales the morning air. He walks past various other animals. A cow moos and a wolf barks. Finally, he comes across Lemongrab, who is groaning in a field as he looks down at a lemon he is holding.]
Lemongrab: Impertinence. [He shakes the lemon and drops it onto the ground.] Nyah! Grow! Grooow!
[Finn arrives at the Tree House. He rides a minecart into the mine below, where Jake is digging away at the walls with a pickaxe. Jake strikes the wall and a blue glow appears.]
Jake: Aha! [He takes the diamond and places it alongside a few others in a minecart.]
Finn: [Crashing his minecart into the one containing Jake's diamonds.] Head's up! Oof.
Jake: Oof.
Finn: I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. [He hands Jake the bucket.]
Jake: Thanks, dude.
Finn: Whatcha doing down here anyways?
Jake: Digging up diamonds for a little project.
Finn: I'll help, buddy.
[A montage shows the minecart being filled to the brim with diamonds as the two of them mine.]
Jake: Whew.
[Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up. Jake wheels the diamonds towards a flow of lava. He takes one and polishes it with his wrist. Finn watches from nearby. Then, without warning, he throws a diamond into the lava.]
Jake: Hehe. [He begins throwing away more diamonds.] Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods!
Finn: What the heck man?! [Jake shrugs.] It's such a senseless waste.
Jake: Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire.
Finn: You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro.
Jake: Or [throws more diamonds].
Finn: [Picks up a diamond.] I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way.
Jake: You do you, buddy.
Finn: I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. [He raises his voice as he takes a piston elevator back up to the surface.]
Jake: [Indifferently] Uh huh.
[The camera pans up to show Lumpy Space Princess, Ice King, Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life-Giving, Gunter, and a living block of TNT hanging out in a cave.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Look guys, it was totally epic. I wrecked the library's glass ceiling like, NBD, then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies.
Gunter: [Dismissively] Wenk wenk.
Live-Giving Magus: That's small potaters. We should do something big. I got a storage full of live dynamite. [He pats the life-given TNT and it barks like a dog.]
Ice King: Hey. We should grief Finn and Jake. We could plant a tree on the Tree House! Huh..?
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh. It's totally obvious you've never griefed anybody.
Ice King: That's only technically true. And not to be "that guy", but it's actually [air quotes] "aggrieved".
Lumpy Space Princess: You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang! Only cool mean girls allowed!
Ice King: I'm ice-cool LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess: No! Call me by my gang name!
Ice King: Okay. Gravel Gal.
[The scene changes. Finn is walking through a field. He sighs and takes out the diamond. He walks past Lemongrab again.]
Lemongrab: Hnnngh. Grooooow! [Finn hands him a shovel.] Oh. Yes, of course. [He digs a hole and drops the lemon into it with a grunt, then starts hitting it with the shovel.] Grow. No grooooowth!
[Marceline, Bubblegum, and a group of skeletons are building a windmill nearby. Marceline stretches, then laughs evilly as she summons lightning. Three new skeletons emerge from the ground.]
Marceline: Who here loves windmills? [One of the skeletons raises their hand and Marceline high fives them.] Haha, alright. Now get to work.
Finn: Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill.
Marceline: Thanks. When it's done, I'm gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal.
Skeleton: What's that, boss?
Marceline: Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there?
Finn: A little lump destined for something big.
Marceline: Just like your butt. Hah!
Finn: Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake.
Marceline: Well I recommend building a windmill.
Finn: A diamond windmill.
Princess Bubblegum: No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey. [Finn throws her the diamond and she takes it over to a crafting table.] Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There! [She produces a firework rocket.] I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose.
Finn: [Takes the firework and gestures for a high five.] Up top.
[Before Bubblegum can return the high five, Lemongrab screams from off-screen.]
Princess Bubblegum: What? Aw blocks.
[Lemongrab is repeatedly hitting the lemon with the shovel and grunting.]
Finn: He's been at it all day.
Princess Bubblegum: I should help him. See you later Finn.
Finn: Alright. M'ladies. [He bows to Marceline and Bubblegum.] M'lemon. [He bows to Lemongrab and exits.]
Lemongrab: Nyarg! [He throws away the shovel.]
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, it's okay buddy.
Lemongrab: Can't... tree!
Princess Bubblegum: You can't just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding.
Marceline: Yeah you can.
Lemongrab: What?
Princess Bubblegum: This is an oak sapling. This is a jungle sapling. [She hands him the saplings.]. And this... [She drops a lot of bone meal at his feet.] This is a lot of bone meal.
Marceline: Courtesy of Marceline the Bone Meal Queen.
Princess Bubblegum: Now we don't actually need the bone meal but it'll help speed things up, and as for the space requirements on the ground, it depends... [She is drowned out by Lemongrab screeching joyfully.]
[The scene changes. Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig are playing cards in their cabin.]
Tree Trunks: How many aces do you have?
Mr. Pig: I got five.
Tree Trunks: Oh shoot, I only got two.
[Finn pokes his head in through a window.]
Finn: Hey y'all. [He drops into the room.]
Tree Trunks: Finn!
Finn: I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies.
Tree Trunks: Say no more. [She walks to the oven, humming to herself, and removes a baking tray that resembles a crafting grid. She places onto it the ingredients for a pumpkin pie.]
Finn: I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin.
Tree Trunks: [Puts the ingredients in the oven.] Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins. [She gives Finn a pumpkin and he places it in his bag. The oven dings and Tree Trunks removes the finished pie.] Hot pie.
Finn: [Takes the pie and sniffs it deeply before putting it in his backpack.] Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home...
Tree Trunks: Say no more. [They both turn to Mr. Pig.]
Mr. Pig: Fine.
[Outside, Tree Trunks saddles Mr. Pig, then Finn crafts a carrot on a stick and mounts him.]
Tree Trunks: Bye bye boys.
[Mr. Pig bucks and winnies.]
Finn: Whoa!
Mr. Pig: [Reluctantly chasing the carrot on a stick.] You know you could just tell me where to go.
[Finn ignores him. The sky turns orange as the sun begins to set. Mr. Pig is getting tired and is panting. An enderman carrying a block of snow steps onto the path in front of them.]
Finn: [Whispering and turning his face away.] Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will-
Mr. Pig: What the heck is that?!
[The enderman turns and screeches at them, angered.]
Finn: Oh Glob.
[The enderman drops the snow block and begins teleporting towards them menacingly. They both scream and Mr. Pig bucks Finn off before running away.]
Finn: Hey!
Mr. Pig: Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee!
Finn: Enderman! Fight me! [He pulls out the pumpkin pie and realizes he doesn't have a weapon.] Oh no.
[As the enderman rushes towards him, Finn closes his eyes and looks down at the ground. This causes the enderman to stop just in front of him.]
Finn: So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?
[Peppermint Butler enters holding an emerald block, then covers his eyes and runs away after spotting the enderman.]
Finn: I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else.
[It begins to rain. The scene changes to show Lemongrab piling bone meal onto the saplings. It suddenly grows into a small tree.]
Lemongrab: Who-aah? Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
[Princess Bubblegum is sat on top of the finished windmill.]
Princess Bubblegum: Whew. Good work. Let's call it a day.
[The skeletons return to the ground and Marceline flies up to join her on the roof. She hands her an apple and they both eat. Darkness falls and the moon rises. Finn is still trapped with the enderman just in front of him. He is sweating profusely and whistling nervously. Lumpy Space Princess is sleeping in a dirt shelter nearby.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Muttering in her sleep] Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans. [She wakes up.] That noise. [She heads over to Finn.] Finn, I'm trying to sleep!
Finn: [Whispering] Hey LSP. Don't be scared.
Lumpy Space Princess: [Speaking at regular volume] What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes?
Finn: Yeah, I have to.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about?
[The enderman gets so bored of Lumpy Space Princess' rambling that they leave.]
Finn: [Suddenly hugs Lumpy Space Princess] Thank you I've been stuck here so long!
Lumpy Space Princess: [Blushing] Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here!
Finn: Fair enough. [He exits.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Quietly] But come back after you've showered.
[Ice King flies up to Finn while he's walking and steals the pumpkin out of his bag.]
Ice King: Yoink. [Laughs maniacally.]
Finn: Thief!
Ice King: You got griefed! [He runs into the enderman with a grunt. It turns around and screeches at him. Ice King screams, places the pumpkin on his head, and runs away, pursued by the enderman. He yells in a muffled voice.] I'm not looking at you! I'm not looking!
[The sun rises the next morning. A sheep gets up from where Lemongrab has been using it as a pillow and he wakes up.]
Lemongrab: [Still half asleep] Good morning. How dare you. [With an exclamation of surprise, he notices that the tree has grown, and thinks he sees lemons growing in its leaves.] Lemon seed babies! [Clapping gleefully] Oh, you shall be my true heirs. [He knocks one of them down, revealing that it is in fact an apple.] What?! A apple? [sic] Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE!
[Tree Trunks enters, carrying a sword and a basket.]
Tree Trunks: Oh, gracious. [She begins knocking down apples with the sword into the basket.] Good job, Lemon-crab. [She exits.]
Lemongrab: [Quietly] Pie me. Pie me for my apples.
[The scene changes. Jake is kicking diamonds around in the mine. He sniffs the air.]
Jake: Pie.
[Finn enters and hands him the pie.]
Finn: You won't believe what I went though to get this.
Jake: Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? [They both begin eating the pie.]
Finn: [Sees that Jake has organised the diamonds into a neat pattern.] Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.
[Jake pushes all of the diamonds into the lava at once, destroying the pattern.]
Finn: D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get! [Jake shrugs.] Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again. [He lights the firework rocket and it explodes anticlimactically on the ceiling of the mine. A flow of lava falls from where it exploded.] That was supposed to be fireworks.
Jake: I like this better.
[During the credits sequence, a montage is shown. Marceline and Princess Bubblegum high five having completed the windmill. Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig are left with an excess of pumpkin pies. Lemongrab chops down the apple tree. Ice King builds a dirt shelter while zombies surround him. The enderman places the pumpkin on top of the snow blocks they were carrying earlier, creating a snow golem. The enderman and the snow golem hold hands.]
Princess Bubblegum: [to Finn and Jake] Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.
Finn: You got it, Princess.
Jake: Whatever you want, mama.
Princess Bubblegum: Bubblegum, away!!
[Finn nails a sign with a sledgehammer, and Jake uses his fists as hammers]
Jake: Ow. Ow. Ow.
Finn: There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.
[Finn jumps down the hole, and Jake fishes him out using his arm as a fishing pole and line]
Jake: Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!
Finn: Whoa.
Jake: Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. [holds out picnic equipment]
[A "LUNCH TIME" logo pops up]
Finn: The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.
Jake: Maybe after lunch.
Finn: Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.
Jake: *Pfft* Yeah, right.
Finn: What?
Jake: Without the aid of my magnificent powers... [shapes hand into bottle opener and opens a bottle of water] ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.
Finn: Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?
Jake: Nope. Come get your sandwich. [using Finn's sandwich as a puppet] Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--[Jake bites Finn's sandwich] [using sandwich puppet, muffled] Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!
Finn: We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes. [quickly] Ready set go! [jumps down hole]
Jake: [sighs] I better go after him.
Jake [as sandwich puppet]: No, Jake! Stay here, with me...
Jake: Oh, my... [makes out with the sandwich]
[scene switches to inside the dungeon.]
Finn: Dungeons! Chambers! Woah. [Sees bugbears everywhere] Evil creatures! [laughs as monsters chase him] Treasure chests! [treasure chest is actually a mimic monster, Finn laughs, jumps away as the creature tries to punch him, then the creature vomits gold, coins, doubloons, and rings and rubies]
Finn: Doorways! [floorboards try to close on him] Traps! [Long jumps out of trap] I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! [Lands in chamber, sees a kitten's head sticking out of a black cave entrance]
Finn: Aww!
[cat head turns upside down and ominously meows]
Finn: [freaked out] Oh?
[A demonic cat with a kitten for a tongue comes out, and sucks his tongue back in his mouth]
Finn: Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.
Demon Cat: Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.
Finn: How did you almost know my name?!
Demon Cat: I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. [circles Finn]
Finn: Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!
Demon Cat: You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing... [brandishes claws] ...you should be afraid of.
Finn: You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!
Demon Cat: I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.
Finn: Unzip this! [Does an armpit-fart, jumps back]
[the Demon Cat leaps at him]
Finn: Bleep! [Demon Cat holds him down, and fiendishly bites at him] OOF!
[Finn punches him, the Demon Cat's eyes fill up with blood]
Demon Cat: Now, you DIE!! [Leaps at Finn, and tears up his clothes, then stops]
Demon Cat: Wait a minute. [Sniffs twice] Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! [Runs away]
Finn: Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors. [walks by 3 different doors] Hmm, no to skeletal remains door. [Sees a door that is a monsters mouth, Finn kicks in a skeleton and a trap closes on it] No to giant monster mouth door. [sees key door] Oh! Giant key door it is!
[Tries to open, but it's locked]
Finn: If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it. [shapes his hand like a key] Yeah! Key hand! [tries to open the door, but bruises his hand] Ouch! [notices a green glow coming from a hatch] Hey! What the jug is that?
[Crawls in]
Finn: Oh, sweet, the key!
[Finn sings the Key Song]
[Reaches for key, which is inside a gelatinous green jelly cube]
Finn: Ew, jelly cube?! [Tries to get the key but almost gets sucked in] Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up! [Screaming, falls out of the cube] I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped. [starts dancing, and singing] Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh! [Falls through the floor, lands in a waterfall chamber] Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it. [Jumps onto the floor]
Bucket Knight: Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight! [He appears to be very small]
Finn: Okay, then I won't fight you.
Bucket Knight: No! You must challenge me to-- [Finn interrupts him]
Finn: Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?
Bucket Knight: Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- [Finn runs past him]
Finn: Thanks!
Bucket Knight: Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!
Finn: Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.
Bucket Knight: [to himself] Just add water and... [Pours water on himself] ...exponential growth!
Finn: Aw, buckets.
Bucket Knight: Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!
Finn: [nervously] Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.
Bucket Knight: [smiles] I see...
[Gets chased by Bucket Knight]
Finn: AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole! [Bucket Knight kicks the gorund, which it's vibration sends Finn flying] Aw, nutzoids! [tries to run away, but Bucket Knight slides on the ground, causing Finn to once again, go flying] Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! [jumps up, but Bucket Knight punches him far, bruising him really badly]
Finn: Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.
[Runs away and finally gets to the door, but the Bucket Knight is right behind him. Before he could hit Finn, Finn jumps through the door]
Finn: AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked. [Takes a deep breath] Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye! [The Demon Cat is awake and crawls on a ledge an sees Finn]
Demon Cat: Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not "accompanying" you?
Finn: You mean Jake?
Demon Cat: Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. [Chases Finn]
Finn: Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!
Demon Cat: You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you.
[Finn sits behind a rock pillar, nervous and scared]
Demon Cat: One... two... three! [jumps behind a rock] Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm... [sniffs twice] Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again! [Finn gets more scared] One... two... three! [jumps behind another rock] Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.
Finn: Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool. [a hand touches his mouth] Who the heck--?!
Guardian Angel: Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.
Finn: Re...really?
Guardian Angel: Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.
Finn: Okay. [Flies away with the angel, laughs] This is radical.
Guardian Angel: Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?
Finn: I'm fine, thank you.
Guardian Angel: Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. [Casts healing magic to clean up Finn and fix his clothes]
Finn: Ha ha ha ha ha!
Guardian Angel: I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....
Finn: Aww, yeah!
Guardian Angel: ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.
Finn: Wow... Wait! What??!
Guardian Angel: Trust in your [The "angel" shows her true colors as her face misshapens into a hideous form, and a raspy voice] guardian angel!
Finn: Put me down, lady!
Guardian Angel: As you wish.
[Drops Finn in a cage full of soup and ingredients]
Finn: Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.
Guardian Angel: Now for little kid soup. [Lights a fire] The secret is a low flame over a long period.
Finn: That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.
Guardian Angel: [Flies away with beautiful face] I will save thee, Finn.
Finn: Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake.
Jake: What?
Finn: Jake!
Jake: Finn!
Finn: What are you doing here?!
Jake: I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.
Jake: Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.
[Flashback begins]
Reaper: Choose your dueling weapon!
Jake: Uh... I choose... sandwich! [He grabs his sandwich and fights with the reaper who simply cuts through it with a sword]
Jake: [voiceover] The challenges were impossible for me.
[Goblin King challenges Jake to spitting their spit the farthest and laughs when Jake throws a pathetic spit]
[A monster makes Jake chase a laser pointer, which leads Jake to bump into a wall]
Jake: [voiceover] But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?
Finn: Yeah... I think I do. [Both chuckle, there's a moment of silence]
[A "NEWFOUND RESPECT" logo pops up as they awkwardly handshake]
Finn: Now let's find a way out of this cage.
Jake: I'll get us out with Key Hand! [forms a Key Hand]
Finn: I really don't see any key holes on this cage.
Jake: Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!
Finn: [laughs] I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!
[takes a carrot and lights it on fire, and gives it to Jake. Jake sets the cage's rope on fire, and it drops on the Guardian Angel, killing her]
Jake: Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!
Finn: Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?
Jake: Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!
Finn: Cling!
[Finn laughs, and Jake carries him to the chamber of the crystal eye]
Jake: Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.
Finn: Okay.
Both: Friendship, go!
[Demonic Eye Creatures fly out and Finn and Jake try to kill them, but they melt their weapons]
Finn: If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!
Jake: Me, too!
[Princess Bubblegum flies in on her swan, angry]
Princess Bubblegum: Get on my swan!
[Finn and Jake hop on her swan, which kills all the eye creatures with laser eyes]
Princess Bubblegum: I hope you learned a lesson from all this!
Both: Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever.
[Princess Bubblegum growls]
Jake: [whispers to Finn] Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.
Finn: Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?
Princess Bubblegum: You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!
[The three break out of the dungeon riding the swan. "ADVENTURE TIME" logo pops up just as the episode ends.]
[The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking down a path in a forest.]
Finn: What... is the meaning of "soup"?
Jake: What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?
Finn: What... is the meaning of "spoon"?
Jake: Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.
Finn: Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?
Jake: Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.
Finn: Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.
Jake: Yeah, man, yeah!
Finn: Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.
Jake: Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the—[stops walking] Whoa! What?!
[He walks up to a train, which is passing by on its tracks.]
Jake: What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!
Finn: Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.
Jake: Oh, yeah.
[Finn is now sleeping on the ground.]
Jake: It's two hours later now. What the stunk? [stretches up above the train, seeing that the train is going around in a circular track] Oh, okay. [stretches back down] Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! [grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train] Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. [a door opens behind them] Blingle, blongle, blungle!
[A creature comes running toward them screaming.]
Creature: Gimme! Gimme the loot! [hits Finn's head]
Finn: Ow!
[The creature stomps on Finn's toes.]
Finn: Yeeow!
Creature: Gimme! Gimme that hat! [grabs Finn's hat]
Finn: Knock it off! [punches him in the chest and bites his arm]
Creature: Aah!
[Finn pushes him off the train.]
Creature: Oh, dang!
Finn: [laughs]
Jake: Hey, Finn!
Finn: Whoa!
Jake: Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!
Finn: Dang, look at that sword! [picks up the Lightning Sword] Whoa. Feels kinda right. [waving it around] Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh. [points it at the wall, causing it to shoot electricity] [laughs] Whoa!
Jake: [laughs] Pretty fun, huh?
Finn: Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!
Jake: You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?
Finn: Yes! [runs off]
Jake: [following him] [laughs]
[They enter a different car of the train, where some blue ants await, holding loot in each hand.]
Finn: Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think! [runs past them, zapping each with his sword]
Jake: [laughs] Cool! [picks up loot] [laughs]
[They enter another car, where some rock monsters moan and walk toward them.]
Finn: Ha-ha! Yeah! [slicing each one] Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! [laughs]
[Scene changes to Finn fighting several monsters in quick succession. The last one explodes, getting some of its goo on Jake.]
Jake: [laughs] [to himself] Welcome back, buddy.
Finn: Man, look at all this rad loot!
Jake: Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.
Finn: Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.
Jake: Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.
Finn: Oh, come on. [elbows him lightly] It's fun! Just one more car. Come on. [elbows him] Come on, man! [elbows him again] Come on!
Jake: All right, just one more.
Finn: Ha-ha, yes!
Jake: [sighs]
[They enter another car, but this one appears empty.]
Finn: Hmm? Where is everybody?
Jake: Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.
[A door opens behind them, out of which comes a chubby green monster with a crown that shoot fires.]
Finn: Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! [runs toward the monster]
Jake: Okay, but this is the last one, okay?
Finn: We'll see!
[The monster trips Finn and blasts fire at him, singeing his hat.]
Finn: Ha-ha!
Jake: Hey, man, [hitting monster with a stick] you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.
Finn: [attacking monster] Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.
Jake: [sighs] Okay.
Finn: Hyah! [hits the monster's crown]
[A head grows out of the monster underneath its crown.]
Head: Ahhhh, gimme a break!
[The monster disappears in a flash of light and drops loot.]
Finn: Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! [puts on the crown and dances] Oh, yeah. [the crown emits fire]
[Jake picks up the rest of the loot and tries on a glove, which makes him chubby and green like the monster. He quickly takes it off, throws it on the ground, and kicks it away.]
Jake: No, thank you.
Finn: Jake, hurry. Next car!
[They enter the next car, which contains green jelly creatures.]
Finn: Slime crimes! [starts fighting]
Jake: You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. [sits on a ledge away from the fight]
Finn: [sees a gold shield one monster dropped] Hey.
[A monster squirts some green liquid at Finn, hitting the back of his leg.]
Finn: Ow! [laughing] Ow. Cool... acid!
[The monster squirts again, but Finn picks up the shield and reflects it back at it, killing it. Finn walks over to the loot it dropped. Jake's stomach rumbles.]
Jake: Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?
Finn: Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.
Jake: More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!
Finn: Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.
Jake: 'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.
[Finn kills a monster, which drops some meat.]
Jake: And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—
Finn: [eating noisily] Look. [points to meat] Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. [uses his crown's flames to throw the meat at Jake]
Jake: [dodging it] Aah!
Finn: Hot meat!
[The scene changes to Finn entering another car, in which red ants await.]
Jake: Ants again? [goes to sit in the corner]
Finn: "Ant" no thang! [smashes one] Yah! [smashes another] Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'! [kills another] Forget about "ant"! [kicks one] What's wrong? Feeling antsy? [kills another and continues killing them]
Jake: [sighs] Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!
Finn: Same car, [punches an ant] but those were blue ants. These are red ants.
Jake: Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.
Finn: Man, no way. All this feels good. [smashes another ant] Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." [two ants attack him] Aah! Hey! [knocks them away] Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!
Jake: Finn, [stands up] I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!
Finn: Yeah! [smashes the last ant]
[A door opens, out of which comes the second boss.]
Finn: Boss fight! [charges at it, blasting fire from his crown]
[The monster raises its wand and blasts Finn backwards.]
Finn: [laughs] [gets back up and continues fighting offscreen]
[Blasts from the monster's wand zoom by Jake, who is sitting in a corner. He picks up a pair of pants that one of the ants dropped and puts them on. Finn grunts and an explosion sounds.]
Boss: My jacket-sta! [disappears in a flash of light]
Finn: [holding loot] Check it out: battle moon.
[A small moons orbits around his head. A crystal ball rolls toward Jake.]
Jake: What? [picks it up and looks in it] [gasps] Finn! This is a future crystal! Look!
[In the sphere is Finn in full armor, battling yellow Crystal Ants]
Jake: That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!
Future Finn: [slashes the ants] Get "ant" of town.
Finn: Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!
[Jake gapes.]
[Scene cuts to them entering another car. Jake kicks the wall, and some Hair Apes shoot lightning at Finn, who blocks it with his shield.]
Finn: Oh, Hair Apes!
Jake: Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. [opens up the side of the train] You can come with me if you want.
Finn: What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.
Hair Ape: [hoots] [zaps Finn]
Finn: Yow! [laughs] [shoots a bolt from his wand at the ape, killing it]
Jake: I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.
Finn: You'll be back.
Jake: No, I won't, Finn. [hops onto the outside of the train] Goodbye!
[He makes it sound like he's getting farther away by making his face smaller. He looks back in at Finn.]
Finn: [sighs]
[A Hair Ape shoots some lightning at Finn, but his battle moon blocks it.]
Hair Ape: [hoots]
Finn: Hey! [laughs] [runs toward it] "Hair" we go!
Jake: [climbs on top of the rain, finding a Hair Ape] What're you doin' up here?
Hair Ape: [hoots] [shrugs]
Jake: [takes off his hat and sits next to it] Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?
Hair Ape: [hoots]
Jake: Mm-hmm.
[He takes off his pack, and the Hair Ape pats his leg invitingly.]
Jake: You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?
[The Hair Ape shrugs. Jake rests his head on the Hair Ape's leg and looks up at the stars.]
Jake: I wonder what my kids are doin'. [falls asleep]
[Morning arrives, and Jake hears the Hair Ape rubbing his hands together to zap him.]
Jake: Hey! [dodges zap] I knew it!
[He hits the Hair Ape, which disappears in a flurry of hair. He then picks up his pack, puts on his hat, and picks up the Hair Ape's hat.]
Jake: [walks off] Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! [opens door] Fi—oh! [sees someone with a metal helmet, a cloak of fire, and a battle moon] Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—
Finn: Hey, hey! Jake, it's me! [opens visor to helmet] I'm just all souped up now.
Jake: Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.
Finn: [wiggles his tongue] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.
Jake: Wait, you are! You are one!
Finn: What? Those guys are cool!
Jake: That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! [advancing toward him]
Finn: Jake, stay back. I mean it!
Jake: Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—
[Finn squirts a large amount of silk at him with his spider wand.]
Finn: [laughs]
Jake: Ah, gross! [coughs]
Finn: [grabs Jake's pack] Yoink! [laughs] [runs to the next car] Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here. [reaches into Jake's pack] Apple, apple, chicken, apple... [pulls out future crystal] Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb. [the crystal reveals an old Finn, followed by someone] Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right. [laughs] Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around? [camera zooms in] Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.
Future Jake: Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.
Future Finn: What?
Finn: Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.
[He gets up, and his battle moon falls. He makes his way toward Jake, taking off his helmet on the way.]
Jake: Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.
Finn: [using wand to take back silk] No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.
Jake: You mean we're gettin' off the train?
Finn: Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.
Jake: Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! [hits Finn's head lightly]
Finn: [laughs] No, no for real! [pats forehead] My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here, [hands Jake the future crystal] see for yourself.
[The crystal displays Finn and Jake washing dishes at the Tree Fort.]
Jake: Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.
BMO: Sumo Scootz! [making sfx for the game] Vroom vroom skreeee! [Jake's character defeats Finn's] Winner!
Jake: Whoo! 79th consecutive victory! [stretches his buttocks toward Finn's face] In yo fa-ace! [Finn doesn't react] You okay, buddy? [hits Finn's cheek with one of his buttocks] Still bummed out about Flame Princess?
Finn: [nods]
Jake: Hmm. I know what'll fix you up: girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll—[toilet flushes] [gasps] [hides in the couch] A burgler-mer!
[Finn and Jake approach the bathroom door, and Finn kicks it open. Ice King is washing his hands.]
Finn, Jake, & Ice King: Aah!
Finn & Jake: The Ice King? Grr—eh! [Jake holds his nose]
Ice King: Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?
Finn: Ech. [pinches nose] [nasally] Why are you stinkin' up our house?
Ice King: Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' [takes out banana phone] with you guys—[looks at phone] oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?
Finn: Right.
Ice King: 'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?
Finn: Mmhm.
Ice King: With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?
Jake: Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!
[Ice King sprays air freshener, and Finn and Jake cough.]
Ice King: Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.
[Gunter, wearing Ice King's crown, is shown constructing ice structures.]
Ice King: Should be fine.
Finn: Flame Princess isn't crazy.
Ice King: You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?
Finn: No.
Ice King: Whew!
Finn: She said she wanted time to herself. [walks out]
Ice King: Yeesh.
Jake: Yeah, breakups are tough.
Ice King: Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?
[Scene cuts to a forest with smoke rising from it. Flame Princess rips up some grass and burns it.]
Flame Princess: Uh! It's so confusing!
[A spider-like creature lowers itself on its silk near Flame Princess.]
Flame Princess: Hmm? [to creature] I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.
[Spider creature shakes his head sympathetically.]
Flame Princess: Why do people even have secrets?
[Her heat radiation intensifies and the spider hurriedly scrambles up its silk.]
Flame Princess: It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. [scribbling sounds are heard] Why do I have to feel like this? [hears scribbling sounds] And what is that noise?! Grrr!
[She sees the spider crawling in mid-air. Princess Bubblegum, invisible, punches the spider off of her face.]
Princess Bubblegum: Eh.
Flame Princess: [squints]
Princess Bubblegum: [turning off invisibility] Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.
Flame Princess: [gasps] Are you spying on me?!
Princess Bubblegum: What?! No, of course not!
[Several cameras and a microphone spontaneously reveal themselves. Princess Bubblegum hits a button on her watch and they become invisible again.]
Princess Bubblegum: I was observing you—for research. [sighs] You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.
Flame Princess: So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?
Princess Bubblegum: Umm, yeah, basically!
Flame Princess: Then I'll help you.
Princess Bubblegum: You will?
Flame Princess: Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.
[Scene cuts to Flame Princess strapped down in a metal room with Princess Bubblegum and Cinnamon Bun observing from behind a large glass window.]
Princess Bubblegum: [talking into microphone] Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.
Flame Princess: This is going to help me understand myself?
Princess Bubblegum: There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.
Flame Princess: Oh. That's good... I guess.
Princess Bubblegum: Initiate test. [a phone drops down and knocks her hand away from the button] Yah. [puts phone to her ear] Hello?
Jake: Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!
[Snow-a-constrictors are shown wrapped around Ice King and Finn, who is hacking at one with his sword.]
Jake: Aaaah—[gets disconnected]
[Princess Bubblegum hits the button, lowering a large metal contraption towards Flame Princess. A small screen hanging by a cord drops down.]
Princess Bubblegum: Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?
Cinnamon Bun: Yes.
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door. [points to a door behind Flame Princess] So that's two things: write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?
Cinnamon Bun: Yes, Princess.
[Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun opening the very same door as the floor underneath him stretches toward Flame Princess.]
Cinnamon Bun: [laughs] Hello.
Flame Princess: Hello.
Cinnamon Bun: You look sad.
Flame Princess: Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.
Cinnamon Bun: Ha, me too.
Flame Princess: Really?
Cinnamon Bun: Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.
Flame Princess: She is?!
Cinnamon Bun: I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.
Flame Princess: What about the tests?
Cinnamon Bun: I'm not good at tests.
[Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house, where Flame Princess is sitting on the couch next to Cinnamon Bun's "dog" (a squash with a mop on its head). Cinnamon Bun is preparing tea.]
Cinnamon Bun: La-de-da-de-da [hums] His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. [walks into coffee table, leaving a notch in his leg] Ow. My body is soft. [extends leg toward Flame Princess]
[Flame Princess places her hand on the wound, healing it perfectly.]
Cinnamon Bun: [gasps] [shakes his leg] We're friends.
Flame Princess: Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.
Cinnamon Bun: Is the princess your friend?
Flame Princess: I don't know.
Cinnamon Bun: Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.
Flame Princess: [gasps]
[Title card: 15 YEARS AGO. Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom.]
Messenger: The word! The word!
Flame King: What's the word?
Messenger: The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of.
Flame King: Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish.
Messenger: Okay! [runs off]
[Scene cuts to the messenger carrying a baby Flame Princess through a forest. He sets her down, and she tries to walk but falls backwards. The messenger catches her.]
Messenger: Oop. Hup. [helps her walk]
[Flame Princess starts walking on her own away from the messenger.]
Messenger: Ah! [catches up to her and picks her up] Aw. [makes baby noises] [tickles her face]
Flame Princess: [giggles] [her flames intensify]
[Scene cuts to the messenger handing Flame Princess to Rock Woodsman.]
Messenger: [sighs] Hmm. [starts crying and runs off]
Rock Woodsman: Ho-ho! [puts Flame Princess down and starts sawing wood]
[Flame Princess walks into the lumberjack's house and sets it on fire.]
Rock Woodsman: [gasps] WAAAAAAAAAH!
Flame Princess: [laughs] [runs into the forest, burning trees] Bah. [knocks down a tree, behind which can be seen the Candy Kingdom in the distance] Ca'tle.
Princess Bubblegum: [looking through a telescope] What's this?
[Scene cuts to Princess Bubblegum in a fireproof suit walking up to Flame Princess.]
Flame Princess: Kih, kih.
[Princess Bubblegum picks her up.]
Princess Bubblegum: A princess? Must've wandered off.
[Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom.]
Princess Bubblegum: Flame King?
Flame King: What do you want, princess of the Gum World?
Princess Bubblegum: I found your lost daughter.
Flame King: I-I don't remember losing anything.
Princess Bubblegum: Pssh.
Flame King: Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.
Princess Bubblegum: That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.
Flame King: Pssh, fine.
[Scene cuts to baby Flame Princess in the lantern.]
[Scene cuts back to Flame Princess in Cinnamon Bun's house.]
Flame Princess: [stands up] [groans in frustration] Is everybody in this world hiding something?
Cinnamon Bun: It's fun to hide.
Flame Princess: You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.
Cinnamon Bun: Wait, do you mean baby jail?
Flame Princess: I don't know, man.
Cinnamon Bun: Mmmm...
[Scene cuts to Finn and Princess Bubblegum walking up to a metal door.]
Finn: Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.
[Finn shakes snow off his head as Princess Bubblegum pushes buttons on a keypad next to the door.]
Finn: So, uh, why am I here again?
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.
[Finn frowns, and the door opens.]
Princess Bubblegum: Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—[gasps]
[The metal contraption is out of control, frantically moving up and down and smoking.]
Princess Bubblegum: CINNAMON BUN!!!
[Scene cuts to Cinnamon Bun's house. Finn and Princess Bubblegum arrive via carriage and walk up to the door.]
Princess Bubblegum: There's a note [reading it] "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."
[Cinnamon Bun's "dog" is on the doorstep next to a bowl of dog food.]
Finn: Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!
Princess Bubblegum: And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!
Finn: We gotta save her. Let's doogie!
[Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom. Finn and Princess Bubblegum, dressed in fireproof suits, walk up to a couple Flame Guards.]
Flame Guard #1: State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.
[Jerry turns his head.]
Finn: Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.
Flame Guard #1: Yeah, but why?
Finn: Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!
Jerry: Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?
Flame Guard #1: Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.
Finn: Honest my fist! [punches Flame Guard, pushes him down, and headbutts Jerry] Come on, Princess!
[The two run inside but are blasted back by a huge fireball.]
Flame Guard #2: D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.
Finn: Man.
[A Flame Person walks up to the three guards.]
Jerry: Halt. What is your business here?
Flame Person: I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.
Flame Guard #2: Pass, friend.
Finn: Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.
Princess Bubblegum: And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.
Flame Guard #1: Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.
Princess Bubblegum: We need to see the king?
Flame Guard #1: Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. [leads them inside] There you go: [Flame Princess is seated on the throne wearing royal garb] the new Flame King.
Finn: Flame Princess?
Flame Princess: Finn?
Finn: You're okay! Um, how's it going?
Flame Princess: Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.
Princess Bubblegum: Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.
Flame Princess: That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.
Finn: Oh.
Flame King: [from inside lantern] Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.
Flame Princess: You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!
Flame King: But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.
Flame Princess: You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!
Cinnamon Bun: [wearing a conical fire hat] Hi.
Finn: Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.
Princess Bubblegum: Take off that silly hat. We're going home.
Cinnamon Bun: No. Look, [pets Jake 2] got a real dog now! Hah.
Finn: Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—
Flame Princess: Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.
Finn: So, does that mean we're still going out?
Flame Princess: No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.
Finn: I see. [gets on the ground and goes into fetal position]
Flame Princess: But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.
Finn: [stands up] Anything.
Flame Princess: That you'll be completely honest with me.
Finn: Heh. Okay. I promise.
Flame Princess: [laughs lightly] I'm serious.
Finn: Hmm.
[In the Tree Fort, Jake is knitting on the couch and humming to himself. A fly-sized Magic Man flies in and lands on his head.]
Magic Man: Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough. [injects Jake with syringe] Bzzzzz... [flies away]
Jake: [stops humming] Hmm. [rubs eyes] I'll... I'll finish this later. [yawns and lies down] So tired. And also hungry... [rubs belly] Maybe I should... eat some— [starts snoring]
[Jake's face starts sliding down from his head and onto his chest. It then sinks into his body. Jake wakes up looking at a yellow sky.]
Jake: Huh? Uh... [touches yellow grass] Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me.
[A forest, mountains, and a flower grow out of the ground.]
Jake: Pretty neat. I bet there's, like—like a cool city or something around here.
[A city grows out of the ground.]
Jake: Nice. Jake City. [walks into city]
[Inside, Jake People grow out of the sidewalk and walk past him while waving.]
Jake Person: Hi!
Jake: Oh, uh, hi!
[Across the street, some more people wave to him.]
Jake Person: Jake! How you doing, Jake?
Jake: [waving] Uh, good, man! Good!
[A car drives past; its driver waves.]
Jake: Man, this place is awesome! [approaches a storefront] Ooh! [looks through glass] Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza...
[The ground starts rumbling.]
Jake: Whoa-oh! Some kind of Jake-quake...
[Behind him, Goose grows out of the ground.]
Goose: Eh? Is that Jake?
Jake: [turns around] Hey there, um...
Goose: C'mon, man! It's Goose! Your best friend, Goose!
Jake: Oh, uh, of course! Goose!
Goose: Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years?
Jake: Let's see, uh... [counts on fingers] one, two, uh... I've never been here.
Goose: [laughs] "I've never been here." You've still got it, Jake.
Jake: [fake-laughs]
Goose: C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.
Jake: Eh—party?
Goose: No. Par-tay!
[Jake and Goose walk to the party. Outside the building, a group of people cheer and applaud his arrival, and a band plays a lively tune. A banner reads "WELCOME HOME JAKE." Inside, portraits of Jake and his family line the walls, and dozens of partygoers dance. Jake and Goose are building card houses.]
Jake: [laughs] Do it again, Goose!
[Goose bounces his head up and down so his jowls slap together.]
Jake: [laughs]
Goose: Hey, Jake.
Jake: Hey, what?
Goose: Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me?
Jake: Uh, what five bucks?
Goose: Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?
[Just then, another Jake-quake shakes the building.]
Jake: What—? What is that?
Goose: Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do not—don't worry about that.
Jake: [thinking] Guess I'd better not worry about it. [aloud] Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.
Goose: I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.
[The building rumbles briefly, knocking down the partially built card houses.]
Goose: [leaving] Just a sec. [gets food from the fridge and returns] Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!
[Another brief Jake-quake occurs.]
Jake: All right! [takes a bite] Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos... [ground rumbles] but Jakey needs nachos! Aah!
[Someone knocks on the front door. Jake answers it.]
Urchin: Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway.
Jake: Alright, lad, show me the way! [follows Urchin]
[In the Tree Fort, Finn walks up to Jake.]
Finn: Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question: do you like cereal in your cake? Jake? [pats him] Hmm... [shrugs and smiles] Mm-mm-mm.
Urchin: Mr. Mayor.
Mayor: Urchin, thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes.
Urchin: Right-o!
Mayor: [shaking Jake's hand] Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it.
Jake: Heh. Okay.
Mayor: Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds.
Jake: Hmm.
Mayor: And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival.
Jake: Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.
[Scene cuts to the Mayor and Jake on the floor with the scientists.]
Mayor: Here are some of the minds.
Scientist: Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes.
Jake: There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry, [pats belly] and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.
[The Mayor and the scientists laugh out loud.]
Jake: I'll prove it!
Scientists: Huh?
Jake: Mention a food item.
Scientist: Omelet.
[The ground rumbles.]
Jake: What's in the omelet?
[The ground briefly shakes again.]
Scientist: Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet!
[The ground shakes violently. A large metal pole falls toward them.]
Scientist: Watch out!
[It crashes to the ground, leaving the scientists unharmed.]
Scientist: Analysis, Tim!
Tim: It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal!
Jake: Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.
Tim: That doesn't sound very science-y.
Scientist: No, but you have my permission to test your idea.
Erik Adamkinson: I don't like that idea.
Scientists: Huh?
Erik Adamkinson: If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely!
Tim: Oh, Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories.
Erik Adamkinson: Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately!
Jake: What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.
[The ground shakes.]
Mayor: Seize him!
Jake: Uh, peace! [grows in size]
[Several Jake People jump on him and hold him down.]
Jake: Why?!
Mayor: Finish him.
[One last Jake Person jumps on Jake, landing on Jake's face. Jake is now in a tiny cell, guarded by two Jake People.]
Jake: [sadly] Mm. [longingly] Bagel.
[Jake's stomach growls, and the ground shakes.]
Erik Adamkinson: Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody.
[The crowd cheers. One Jake Person runs after Erik Adamkinson.]
Erik Adamkinson's father: Wait! Wait! [hugs Erik Adamkinson] I want to go with you, Son!
Erik Adamkinson: I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared.
Erik Adamkinson's father: My son. [weeps]
[Erik Adamkinson climbs to the top of a mountain and then climbs the wall. A balloon floats next to him.]
Erik Adamkinson: Huh? [grabs balloon] Yeah!
[The balloon takes him higher.]
Erik Adamkinson: There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole!
[Erik Adamkinson passes through the sky-hole and climbs onto Jake's body. Projected on a screen nearby is a movie with a bear and a rabbit.]
Erik Adamkinson: Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be— [gasps]
[Finn lifts his head with spaghetti hanging out of his mouth and looks at Erik Adamkinson.]
Erik Adamkinson: [screams and then weeps] I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not! [cries] You're hideous! Hideous! [melts into Jake's body]
Finn: [points to projector] BMO, resume.
[Back in Jake World]
Jake: Spaghetti... [stomach rumbles]
[In the city, the dolls Jake was looking at earlier fall down as people scream in panic. Outside Jake's cell, one guard is checking his phone, while the other is about to touch him with his spear.]
Guard: Don't!
[The guards hear a slapping sound.]
Guards: Huh?
[Out of a bush pops Goose, slapping his jowls together. The guards laugh and run to him.]
Guard: Hey, you're a le—
[Goose smacks them down with his jowls.]
Jake: [sighs] Huh?
[Goose bends the bars of the cell with his jowls.]
Jake: Goose?
Goose: Go.
Jake: But—but what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can't bring you back?
Goose: Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks.
Jake: But—
[Goose slaps Jake with his jowls.]
Goose: Go eat, Jake!
[Jake takes a huge breath, steps out of his cell, and stretches straight up. Goose waves goodbye as he is pulled into the ground. As Jake grows taller, Jake People in the city get pulled into the ground, and then the city gets pulled in. Jake yells as he continues stretching his way up to the sky hole. The screen goes black.]
Finn: Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?
Jake: [eating beans] Just getting a snack, Goose. [sheds a tear] Just getting a snack.
[The scene begins at the Tree Fort.]
Jake: And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!
Finn: No way!
Jake: Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.
[warbling with tongue]
Finn: Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.
Jake: Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.
Finn: Reliable? Rats!
Jake: Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!
Finn: This tree?!
Jake: [ominously] Good niiiight...
Finn: Jake?
[Jake warbling downstairs]
Finn: You're full of it, Jake!
[Jake warbling ominously]
Finn: Errr... [he hears croaking and sees a worm on his bed] NO WORMS ON THE BED! [Hits worm with the Enchiridion.]
[Sees a tree limb tapping on his window, then a mysterious figure taps on the window]
Finn: Huh? [Lightning crashes, and the figure's scary face is seen]
Finn: AAAAAH!!! [Runs downstairs]
Finn: Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--
Jake: Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.
Finn: But you said you heard it from a reliable source!
Jake: Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [laughs]
[the window blows open by itself, the lights go out, and Jake screams]
Finn: No one's outside.
Jake: Whew!
Finn: It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.
Jake: I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!
Finn: You're a total wuss, man.
[a bag drops, there is a vampire on the ceiling that hisses and scares Finn and Jake]
Marceline: Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.
Finn: [afraid] Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!
Jake: Don't suck our blood!
Marceline: [laughing] Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. [Lights candles]
Finn: Soooo, you don't suck blood?
Marceline: Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.
[Sucks the red out of a strawberry, and gives it to Finn]
Marceline: Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"
Finn: Like what?
Marceline: I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. [A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish]
Marceline: And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. [A flashback of Marceline hula-hooping in the Fire Kingdom]
Finn: OOO!
Marceline: Oh, and check these out. [She has nuts in her hands]
Finn: Nuts?
Marceline: Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. [Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink.]
Finn: [laughs] You're wonderful.
Jake: Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.
Marceline: You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.
Finn: What?
Marceline: [sighs] Look. [She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an "M" carved into the tree] "M" for "Marceline."
Jake: Aw, man.
Marceline: I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. [Flings them out]
Marceline: But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!
[Shuts the door]
Marceline: Good night!
Jake: Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.
Finn: She can't kick us out of our house!
Jake: Finn!
Finn: Get down here, lady, and fight me!
Jake: She's a vampire, dude!
[Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet, and throws it onto Finn]
Finn: I'm gonna kill her.
Jake: Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!
[Marceline hisses at them and then walks away, laughing]
Finn: But, what about our home?
Jake: A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.
Finn: But I like our home.
Jake: Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.
Finn: Really?
Jake: Yeah, man! It is so nuts!
Finn: You always know what to say.
Jake: Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!
Finn: (laughs) Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!
Jake: Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. [Clouds separate to reveal the sun] Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?
[House Hunting Song begins]
Finn: This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.
Jake: Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [plays viola] La, la, la... [singing] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...
Finn: I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...
Jake: [singing] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [talking] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears]
Finn: Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.
Jake: I'd rather be dancing with some babes!
Finn: [laughs] Shut up, dude!
Jake: Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!
Finn: And abandoned. [Echoes]
[both scream]
Finn: [gasps] Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?
Jake: Yes.
♪ "So they cleaned the cave and built a house inside the cave. ♪
Jake: So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.
Finn: Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?
Jake: Let's trash it and throw a party!
Finn: Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?
Jake: Yeah, man.
Finn: Aww, yeah, I know, too.
Marceline: Hey, Finn.
Jake: She's back!
Marceline: Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.
Finn: What do you want, Marceline?!
Marceline: Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!
Finn: What!?
Marceline: Thanks for fixing the place up for me.
Finn: Y-You can't take our home twice!
Marceline: [With guitar] Yes, I caaaannnnnn!
Finn: AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!
Jake: Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?
Finn: But she's taking our home again!
Jake: We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?
Finn: Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!
Marceline: Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!
Jake: [yells]
Finn: What!?
Marceline: I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.
Jake: Nooo!
Finn: Let go of Jake!
Marceline: Make me.
[Finn slaps Jake out of Marceline's grip]
Finn: You okay, pal?
Marceline: [transforming] No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!
Finn: I'm not scared of you!
Jake: Finn!
Marceline: [laughs] You're pathetic, little boy!
Finn: [grunts] You're pathetic! [Spits] Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!
Marceline: Make me. [Slaps Finn's butt and laughs] Bleh-bleh! Blah!
Jake: I've... gotta help my buddy.
Marceline: Your blood is mine!
Jake: [warbles]
Finn: [screaming] Jake!
Jake: Uh oh.
[Marceline sucks Jake's blood and throws Jake's remains on the ground; she laughs.]
Finn: [Screams; runs up to her and punches her in the face]
Marceline: Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. [laughs and kisses him on the cheek, making him blush.]
Finn: Why didn't you just kill me?
Marceline: 'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.
Jake: Finn!
Finn: Aren't you dead?
Jake: Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? [Does so]
Marceline: [Clears throat] You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.
Finn: Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?
Marceline: Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh!
[Finn and Jake both run away screaming]
[Scene cuts back to the tree fort]
Finn and Jake: Yeah!
Finn: Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED!
King Worm: Oh, hey, guys. Come here, friends... Hug me... wawawawawawawa... Aw, yeah, hug me... wawawawawawawawa...
[Episode ends]
[A thunderstorm rages outside the Tree Fort. Inside, BMO is practicing karate.]
BMO: Kya! Kya! [reading karate magazine] Hmm.
[The magazine reads, "How to stop a man's heart with karate: 1. 'Focus chi' and 2. 'Stop a man's heart'" with diagrams depicting each action.]
BMO: Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya! [punches a hole in the punchbag pillow]
Jake: [covers ears] BMO... keep it down!
BMO: But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time!
Jake: I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.
Finn: What's wrong, dude?
Jake: I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.
Finn: Is that from getting chubby?
Jake: What? No, man, it's just restless leg.
Finn: Oop! My bad.
Jake: What are you reading?
Finn: This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. [closes magazine]
Jake: Cool.
Finn: Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.
Jake: [blows raspberry]
BMO: [sing-song] Jake...
Jake: No, BMO.
BMO: KYA! [punches pillow]
Jake: [screams] No, BMO! No more! [walking into kitchen] Maybe some soup will take the edge off.
[Jake starts preparing a pot of soup. A fly lands on the edge and slurps it.]
Jake: Ew! Gross! Nasty! [smacks it with a flyswatter] Hyah!
[The fly flails its legs a little, then stops moving.]
Jake: I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature.
BMO: Kya! Kya! Kya!
Jake: BMO, PLEASE!
[Outside, the rain has stopped. Jake climbs upstairs and into his bed.]
Jake: [yawns, smacks lips]
[Suddenly, some rattling and knocking sounds are heard coming from downstairs.]
Jake: [sits up] Finn, was that you?
Finn: [snores]
Jake: [lies back down] Probably just BMO or something.
[The record downstairs is heard playing jazz.]
Jake: That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz. [climbs downstairs] Yeesh. Creepy. [takes the needle off the record]
[On a shelf above Jake, a toy monkey starts clacking its cymbals together repeatedly.]
Jake: [gasps] [fearfully] I didn't know we had one of those.
Voice: [spookily] Oooooo...
Jake: [panting] Hey, hey. Hey, who?
[A ghost fly appears and slowly moves toward Jake.]
Jake: Aah!
Ghost Fly: Ooooooo...
Jake: Hey! I killed you!
[The fly swoops at Jake and buzzes around his head.]
Jake: Aah! [tries waving it away, then runs] Aah! Ghost fly touching me! [climbs upstairs] Finn! Finn!
[The fly continues buzzing around Jake.]
Finn: [jerks awake] Aah!
Jake: Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
Finn: Okay.
Jake: Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!
Finn: So what?
Jake: No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.
[The ghost fly swoops in and out of Jake's torso.]
Jake: Aah!
[The ghost fly conjures a scythe out of nowhere and chases after Finn and Jake. They dodge its attack and jump downstairs.]
BMO: Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!
Finn & Jake: Ghost fly!
BMO: [screams]
[The three run out of the tree fort. They stop after a few seconds.]
Jake: [sighs] Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.
[Suddenly, the ghost fly appears beside him.]
Ghost Fly: Whoo. [swishes scythe]
Jake: [screams]
BMO: Run! Just run!
[Jake and BMO bump into Finn.]
Finn: Ay-ay-ay-ay!
[They all run back into the Tree Fort, with the ghost fly follows closely. BMO stops and turns around to face it.]
BMO: Hmm. [punching] Kya! Kya!
[The ghost fly telepathically levitates BMO and throws it against the wall.]
Jake: We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.
Finn: Ghost fly, what's your problem?!
[The ghost fly swipes its scythe at him.]
Finn: Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!
[The ghost fly swipes two more times.]
Finn: Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.
Jake: Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice. [dials phone]
[The scene cuts to a silhouette sitting at a table. His phone rings twice; he silences it. The silhouette, wearing a hat and carrying a bag, approaches the Tree Fort. Back inside, Finn, Jake, and BMO are hiding inside a suit of armor.]
BMO: Is he coming soon?
Jake: I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.
Finn: That's cool.
[The ghost fly flies into the suit of armor.]
Finn, Jake & BMO: [scream]
[Finn throws off the top half of the armor and runs. Clattering and shouting are heard offscreen as the mysterious person enters the Tree Fort. Finn, Jake, and BMO are hiding behind a table barricade while the fly swipes at them. On hearing the person enter, the fly turns toward him.]
Ghost Fly: Woo?
Peppermint Butler: Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do.
Ghost Fly: Woo! [swipes at Peppermint Butler]
Peppermint Butler: Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water! [throws water at the ghost fly]
[The ghost fly dodges it and flies into a hole in the wall.]
Jake: [quietly] Thank you.
Peppermint Butler: [drawing chalk circles around Finn, Jake, and BMO] These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safe—as long as... [the ghost fly picks up the bag] we... have...
[The ghost fly takes the bag into the hole in the wall. Peppermint Butler puts his hat on, jumps out the window, and runs away. The ghost fly comes out and flies toward Jake but is stopped by the circle.]
Jake: Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.
[The ghost fly buzzes in circles around them while wailing spookily. A time lapse shows storm clouding rolling past the Tree Fort. Eventually, the ghost fly stops.]
Ghost Fly: Woo! [flies offscreen]
[Finn hears the sound of papers rustling.]
Finn: Hmm?
[On the table, the magazine he was reading flips to the page he was on and turns toward him.]
Finn: [gasps] The end of my story. And it's so close.
Jake: Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
Finn: I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha! [grabs chalk and draws a bigger circle] Mm?
Jake: Dude, what are you—?
Finn: If I extend the circle... [erases old circle] farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
BMO: Theoretically, that is possible.
Jake: Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea.
Finn: Just have to stay inside this circle.
[From an aerial view, the "circle" is evidently an outline of a woman.]
Finn: Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters? [picks up magazine] [laughs] Man, what a great ending! [laughs again, but suddenly starts gagging]
Jake: Finn? What's wrong, buddy?
Finn: [breathing strangely] [turns around, revealing he has transformed into a fly]
Jake & BMO: [scream]
Jake: Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!
[Finn crouches and grunts as he sprouts two wings. He flies up to the ceiling and spits on the floor near Jake and BMO.]
Jake: Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!
BMO: Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.
Jake: What?
BMO: It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.
Jake: [looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling] Finn... [to BMO] All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.
BMO: Tell me a joke.
Jake: Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?
BMO: Kya! [punches Jake]
Jake: [choking] [becomes pale and falls backwards]
BMO: I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
Ghost Jake: Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow! [disappears]
BMO: Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? [holds up fingers] This many!
Jake: Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.
[Several spirits of insects, animals, and furniture are seen.]
Jake: Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.
[Finn's body suddenly drops onto Jake's.]
Jake: Aah!
[The ghost fly flies toward him and gashes his arm.]
Jake: Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!
[The ghost fly starts chasing Ghost Jake.]
Jake: Ohh! Ohh! Get away! [throws a ghost cat at the ghost fly]
[The ghost fly cuts it in half, causing it to disappear.]
Jake: Aah! You killed it! Aah!
[The ghost fly cuts a ghost table in half and continues chasing Jake.]
Jake: Aah! Aah! Get away!
[Jake continues throwing ghosts at the ghost fly, who slices each in half with his scythe. The ghost fly then catches up with Jake and slices his lower back.]
Jake: [screams]
[Floating into the kitchen, Jake trips over a cat and bumps the stove, knocking the pot of soup onto the floor. The ghost fly charges toward Jake.]
Jake: [screams]
[Just then, the ghost of the soup appears beside Jake.]
Ghost Soup: Oooooo...
Ghost Fly: [stops] Hmm?
Ghost Soup: Hoooooo!
[The ghost fly starts slurping the ghost soup.]
Jake: That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!
Ghost Fly: [nodding] Woo-woo.
Jake: And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.
[The ghost fly nods and starts shining and ascending slowly.]
Jake: [in awe] Ahhh. Bam! [slaps the fly to the floor, making it disappear in a cloud of smoke] Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! [blows at smoke] Yes! [starts ascending and glowing] What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!
[Jake wakes up in a hospital bed.]
Jake: Mm. BMO?
[Finn and BMO run to Jake and embrace him.]
Finn: Jake, I missed you, bro!
BMO: Jake!
Finn: Don't ever leave me again!
Jake: Good job, BMO! You brought me back.
BMO: [weakly] Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.
[Doctor Princess and Nurse Pound Cake are standing by with a defibrillator, having just used it on Jake.]
Doctor Princess: Whew!
[The episode starts with Finn, Jake, and BMO playing a game of bocce. BMO throws a ball.]
BMO: Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month.
Jake: Deal.
[Turtle Princess goes by on a slow-moving rocket.]
Turtle Princess: Hi, guys!
Finn, Jake, & BMO: 'Sup, Turtle Princess?
[She leaves them. Scene cuts to Lumpy Space Princess swatting bugs off of herself.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Get your hands off me, Steven!! YAH! [Throws him down] And you, too, Chad! [Flicks ant away]
[Turtle Princess enters.]
Turtle Princess: Heeeey, giiiirl!
Lumpy Space Princess: Heeeey, giiiirl!
Turtle Princess: Brought you some little fruit pies.
Lumpy Space Princess: Awesome. [Starts eating]
Turtle Princess: How ya doin' out here?
Lumpy Space Princess: Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone!
Turtle Princess: Huh... it must be nice.
Lumpy Space Princess: Nah. It's horrible. They just want me for my lumps! [Vulture screeches at them.] These lumps aren't for SALE, BILLY! [Throws fruit pie at vulture making it fly away.] [To Turtle Princess] Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps?
Turtle Princess: Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books. [Gasps] Hey! You should write a book telling me how to do it!
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies! [Snake hisses at her] YAH! [Hits it] BACK UP OFF ME, RICKY!! [To Turtle Princess] Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!
[Two balls land in front of them. Finn enters.]
Finn: Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!
Turtle Princess: [Gasps] LSP! Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies!
[BMO and Jake enter.]
BMO: Yay! I win! [To Jake] Bow to your sensei!
Jake: Aaah...
Finn: Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
Turtle Princess: [To Lumpy Space Princess] You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!
Lumpy Space Princess: I'll do it! For the world! And for you, girl!
Turtle Princess: Oh, girl!
[They both smile. Lumpy Space Princess grabs a plastic grocery bag off the ground and dons it like a spaghetti-strap dress. Scene shifts to the Grasslands; Lumpy Space Princess is going to the Tree Fort.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Recording herself] Day one: on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side-note: I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse. Mm! Mm! Mm! [Takes out a fruit pie and "puts on" its custard before eating the fruit pie; knocks on Finn and Jake's front door; Jake answers.]
Jake: Hello?
Lumpy Space Princess: [Seductively] Heeey, Jaaaake... Is Finn hooome...?
Jake: [Wincing in disgust] Ooh!
Finn: 'Sup, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.
Finn: Wha?
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it. [Starts digging through bag] Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.
Finn: [Reading fake ad] "WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY." [Sniffs it] Smells like fruit pie.
Jake: It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] Dude, look at 'er.
Lumpy Space Princess: [Messily slathering custard on her face] Mmm... Oh, Glob...
Finn: Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.
[Jake hesitates speaking for a moment]
Jake: Alright, LSP. Come inside.
Lumpy Space Princess: Awesome. [Recording herself] Totally nailed the interview. [Licks custard off face]
[The three walk inside.]
Lumpy Space Princess: I'm gonna need a secretary desk! [She immediately forces dishes off a table ("Rrr-AAAGH!") and puts her working equipment. Finn and Jake just look at each other.] I'm starving! What's for dinner?!
Finn: Oh. Uh... [Checks fridge] We got some blueberries.
Jake: Jake has saltines.
Lumpy Space Princess: Yuck. [Recording herself] Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner. [Seductively] Hey, Finn... [Rubbing her lumps] You got anything better to eat??
Finn: [Focused on the fridge] Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. [Exits]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Recording herself] Chapter 1: "Gotcha!"
[Scene changes to that night.]
Finn: [To Lumpy Space Princess] Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.
Lumpy Space Princess: G'night, you guys! [They go upstairs.] [Recording herself] Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. [Her phone rings (Lumpy Space Princess's ringtone is Turtle Princess saying, "Heeey, girl!" repeatedly) and she answers it.]
Turtle Princess: [On other end] Hey, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out awesome!
Turtle Princess: Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it!
Lumpy Space Princess: Thanks, girl.
Turtle Princess: Goodnight, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess: Goodnight, girl. [Hangs up]
[Scene shifts to the next morning. Lumpy Space Princess wakes up grunting and drooling.]
Lumpy Space Princess: What's that?
[Lumpy Space Princess goes outside to find Finn putting rocks in Jake.]
Jake: 'Sup, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess: What're you guys doing?
Finn: We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!
Finn: That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.
Jake: Yup.
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh... Fine... [Picks up two rocks] You're welcome, Finn.
[Finn gives a thumbs up. The trio starts going to the mountains.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!
Finn: C'mon, LSP. You can make it.
Lumpy Space Princess: Uuoohhh... [Drops the rocks in exhaustion; her phone rings ("Heeey, girl! Heeey, girl!") and she answers.] Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!
Turtle Princess: Good morning, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess: Good morning, girl.
Turtle Princess: Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—
Finn: Hey, LSP, shake a leg.
Lumpy Space Princess: [Whisper] Can't talk right now, girl! [Hangs up]
[The trio arrives at the top of one of the mountains.]
Finn: The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. [Starts throwing rocks into the lake]
Lumpy Space Princess: [To herself] This is way too boring for my book. [Acting] Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? [Finn throws another rock in, paying no attention to her.]
Finn: Haha! Jake! "Ker-ploop."
Jake: Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop."
Lumpy Space Princess: Not... gotcha?
[Finn throws another rock in the lake, and the rock stays on the lake's surface.]
Finn: Alright!
[Finn throws a bunch more rocks in to determine which path to walk in. The trio enters the cave opposite them. Sludge falls on Lumpy Space Princess.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Ugh! This place is plops, Finn!
Finn: We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want. [Continuing on] That weird light...
[The trio eventually stops in front of a strange vortex.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!!
Finn: [Not paying attention] Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—
Lumpy Space Princess: [Swinging around her "dress"] Oooh, my dress...[her dress goes into the portal]
[She drifts into the portal.]
Finn: No, LSP! It's not safe!
[Lumpy Space Princess gets trapped in a room full of mirrors.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Heeeeeeey... [Noticing Finn in a mirror] Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...
[Finn and Jake bang on the wall.]
Finn: She's stuck in there!
Jake: We gotta bust through this wall!
[They attack the wall.]
Lumpy Space Princess: I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. [The reflection of Finn takes off his hat revealing long, luscious hair.] Oh, lump. I took it too far! [The Mirror Finns reach out for Lumpy Space Princess] My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! AAH, NO, AAAAAH!!! [Finn and Jake bust in just in time to defeat the shadow Finns.] OH, I CAN'T LOOK! [Opens one eye] Aah!
[Finn and Jake finish defeating the shadow Finns and pant heavily.]
Lumpy Space Princess: That was so crazy! What just happened?!
Finn: Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good!
Finn: LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good. [Sheaths his sword and grabs Lumpy Space Princess's "dress."] You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff!
Lumpy Space Princess: Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.
[Finn smiles. Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... trashy. Turtle Princess'll be all, [Imitating her] "Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller!" Hah... Yeah. [She looks around with uncertainty and notices Finn sitting on a log outside.] [To Jake] What's he doing out there?
Jake: Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. [Goes upstairs]
[Lumpy Space Princess looks at Finn. Her cellphone rings ("Heeey, girl! He—") and she answers.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [Fearful] Hello?
Turtle Princess: Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh... I'm working on it! I've been doing so much research!
Turtle Princess: Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?
Lumpy Space Princess: [Prevaricating] Um... yeah...
Turtle Princess: Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click! [Hangs up]
Lumpy Space Princess: [To herself] Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot. [Gasps in realization and has flashbacks of Finn from earlier moments in the episode.] ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside! YAAAAGH!! [Pushes equipment off desk in frustration] HE'S GREAT!
[Lumpy Space Princess begins typing a new manuscript. As she's typing, it begins to rain, and Finn runs inside. In response, Lumpy Space Princess hurriedly gathers up her manuscript and leaves as Finn enters.]
Finn: Uh... Bye, LSP.
[Scene cuts to the Library. Turtle Princess reads the manuscript confused.]
Turtle Princess: This isn't what you said it'd be about...
Lumpy Space Princess: I know, I—
Turtle Princess: I LOVE IT!
Lumpy Space Princess: OH, MY GLOB!
[Turtle Princess makes the cover and titles the book "I Wrote a Book." Billy screeches. Back at the Tree Fort, the rain clears, and Lumpy Space Princess returns.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!
Finn: Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.
Lumpy Space Princess: Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!
Finn: [Not seeing anything wrong with this] Oh. Okay.
Lumpy Space Princess: But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!
Finn: Wow. Uh, thanks!
Lumpy Space Princess: No... thank you. [Goes over to a window and opens it to exit]
Jake: LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!!
Lumpy Space Princess: [Whisper] Gotcha... [Slowly exits and floats away from the tree house. Her floating falters for a moment as the episode ends.]
The episode begins with Finn and Jake having a picnic and watching the sunset.]
Jake: Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'?
Finn: I don't know. Who are you bringin'?
Jake: I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude.
Finn: Oh.
[A duck walks up to them and Finn picks it up.]
Finn: I'll take this duck!
Jake: It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch.
Finn: Man, I don't want to be smooched!
Jake: Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules.
Finn: Lame. [Attempts to kiss duck, but it flies away.] Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket! [Kisses blanket.]
Jake: Put the blanket down. [Pats the ground beside him.] Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples.
[Later that day, Finn and Jake are back at the treehouse. Finn is looking for someone to call.]
Jake: You all square?
Finn: Yeah, yeah.
Jake: Who you gonna call?
Finn: I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss. [Calls Princess Bubblegum.]
Princess Bubblegum: [Whistling as she answers the phone.] Hello?
Finn: Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?
Princess Bubblegum: Sounds romantic, Finn.
Finn: No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. [Begins to blush.]
Princess Bubblegum: No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.
Finn: But—
Princess Bubblegum: Auf Wiedersehen! ("Goodbye")
[Hangs up phone and begins to practice her whistling.]
Finn: She doesn't want to go!
Jake: Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you. [Takes out cell phone.] I'm calling Marceline.
Finn: What?
Jake: [Begins to call Marceline.] Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance!
[Marceline answers her phone, half of the screen Jake and half the screen of Marceline.]
Marceline: Speak.
Jake: Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn. [Marceline sneaks out from a pile of dirty clothes behind Jake and begins to approach him.] Marceline? Come in. Hello? [Marceline hisses loudly behind him, making Jake scream loudly.]
Finn: Hehe. Are you gonna help us?
Marceline: Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny.
[Now at the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: Okay, so here's the plan. [Points at Finn] You start saying things and [Points at Marceline] you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum... [Camera pans up to Princess Bubblegum through the window above them.] will get jealous of you [Points at Marceline]. Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off.
Finn: Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?
[Marceline bursts out laughing.]
Finn: Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?
[Marceline laughs even more, very exaggerated.]
Finn: Diggy diggy! [Claps hands.] Diggy diggy!
[Princess Bubblegum appears at window and clears throat.]
Princess Bubblegum: Greetings, Finn. [Unamused tone.] Hey, Marceline...
Marceline: [Waves, amused tone] Hello, Bonnibel.
Princess Bubblegum: [Still umamused] Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn?
Finn: I, um... uh... it's... something.
Princess Bubblegum: Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice! [Walks away, whistling.]
Jake: That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe... [Stretches away.]
Marceline: Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!
Finn: But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
Marceline: [Blows raspberry.] How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?
Finn: Yeah...
Marceline: Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.
Finn: Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F—
Marceline: So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?
Finn: Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight! [Makes fighting sounds & positions.] But girls don't like that.
Marceline: No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. [Floats away.]
Finn: Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn. [Begins to walk after Marceline but is stopped by Jake.]
Jake: Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!
Finn: What is that stuff?
Jake: It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me.
[Now in the hallway outside of Princess Bubblegum's bedroom, Finn is dressed in the lute-suit and Jake is shaped-changed into a chair. Marceline floats down from the ceiling.]
Marceline: Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible!
Jake: It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it!
Marceline: Well, it's going to ruin the plan.
Jake: What she talking about, Finn?
Finn: Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
Jake: Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? [Marceline flicks her tongue at Jake.]
[Princess Bubblegum is heard whistling and walks into the hallway, Jake turns back into a chair and Marceline turns into a bat and flies away.]
Princess Bubblegum: [Whistles.] Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing?
Finn: Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.
[Jake points down at lute he stretched and motions for him to play it.]
Finn: Oh. [Singing and playing the lute.] This is my lute-suit!
Princess Bubblegum: [Starts to laugh.] Finn, that is hilarious! [Starts to laugh again.] Oh, you are killing me! [Giggles.]
Marcelince: Psst! [Still a bat and flying near the ceiling, makes wresting motions and noises.]
Finn: Oh, yeah! [Puts lute on chair-Jake.] So... Headlock! [Puts Princess Bubblegum in a headlock and she falls to the ground screaming.]
Princess Bubblegum: Guards!
[Finn is thrown out of the castle. Jake comes out of the hole in the lute, breaking the strings and falls, dizzy. Marceline sits down next to him and turns back to normal.]
Marceline: That suit was ridiculous.
Jake: Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?
Finn: Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
Jake: Well, fine! You can just give it back then!
[Finn take off suit.]
Finn: I'm sorry!
Jake: Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. [Stretches away.]
Marceline: Gee, he seems pretty ticked.
Finn: Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
Marceline: Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.
Finn: Really?
Marceline: The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!
Finn: Like metaphorically?
Marceline: Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?
Finn: Uhh... [Holds tighter.] Mhmm.
[Marceline takes off and laughs. They fly above a pack of running wolves and start to run with them. Marceline stops and growls at Finn until he begins to growl back and run on all fours. Finn & Marceline begin to run with the wolves, foam coming out of Finn's mouth and howl at the moon with them. Marceline bites the back of the wolf in front of her and Finn does the same. Finn and Marceline begin to ride on the back of two wolves. Marceline and Finn fly two wolves to the Candy Kingdom and outside of Princess Bubblegum's room.]
Marceline: Shhh! She's probably asleep!
[They put the wolves into Princess Bubblegum's room and close the door.]
Finn: This was a really good idea.
Marceline: [Turns into a bat.] Now don't blow it this time!
Finn: Haha, okay.
[Princess Bubblegum screams, runs out of her room and struggles to close the door behind her. She notices Finn.]
Princess Bubblegum: Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!
Finn: Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.
[Banana Guards drag Finn out of the castle.]
Princess Bubblegum: [Sadly] I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. [Walks back into the castle, a pretzel gate sliding closed behind her. A duck quacks, and poos on him.]
Finn: I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. [Marceline puts a finger to his lips.]
Marceline: Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great. [Kisses Finn on the cheek.] Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! [Flies away.]
Finn: Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
Jake: Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?
Finn: Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!
Jake: 'Bout time!
[Marceline is at her house and is about to play her bass, when she hears a lute playing outside. She looks out the window and she's Finn dressed in the lute-suit.]
Marceline: Uh-oh.
Finn: [Makes guitar noises.] Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?!
[Marceline opens door.]
Marceline: We need to talk...
[Finn and Jake walk in.]
Finn: [Singing] Good evening my dear, your escort is here!
Marceline: Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.
Finn: With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.
Marceline: Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with... [Turns into a giant tenctacle monster] this! [Laughs evilly and picks up Finn.] What do you think of me now?
Finn: How do you like your popcorn?
Marceline: Uuugh! [Turns back to normal.] You're starting to annoy me!
Finn: Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!
Marceline: Get off me! [Throws Finn onto her couch and floats down beside him while Jake is hiding behind the couch] Finn, I like you, but I—
Finn: Headlock! [Puts Marceline in headlock.]
Marceline: No! [Pushes Finn off] Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.
[Finn lies down on the couch, sad.]
Marceline: I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.
Finn: Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
Marceline: Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?
Finn: Huh? No! Movies!
Marceline: If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?
Finn: 'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
Jake: I didn't really say all that. [Mumbles something and hides behind couch.]
Marceline: Of course I'll go with you, Finn!
Finn: You will?
Marceline: Yeah, as friends.
Finn: Of course as friends!
Marceline: But no tongue.
Finn: Yea—Wha?
[Marceline and Finn are at Couples Movie Night, sitting on an old truck and watching the intros.]
Finn and Marceline: [Both laughing excitedly]
Finn: Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!
[The movie "Love Kaboom" starts with a woman and man.]
Woman in movie: Oh, mon cher. I guess zese is goodbye.
[Finn is getting weirded out by the movie.]
Man in movie: No, not goodbye. Let's say: Farewell!
[Jake and Lady Rainicorn, Lollipop Girl & Ice Cream Guy are kissing, and so are two bugs in Ice Cream Guy's head. Finn sees all of this and throws up and turns to Marceline, who is also grossed out.]
Finn: Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?
Marceline: There's nothing I'd like more. [Pushes Finn off the truck they are sitting on and flies up.]
Man in movie: Nothing can ever tear us apart.
[Finn tears through the screen and rides off with Marceline on running wolves.]
[The episode begins with Finn walking through some bushes, looking for Jake.]
Finn: [calling] Jake! Jake! [coming out of bushes] Jake? [sees Jake's viola resting on a rock] Hmmm... [picks it up and starts playing it poorly]
Jake: [off screen] Aaaah! [comes out of bushes covering his ears] Aaaaah! [rolls on ground] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! [gets up and knocks the viola out of Finn's hands] Uh! That sounded horrible, man! [picks up viola]
Finn: I don't know how to play.
Jake: Exactly! [starts tuning viola]
[Distant screams are heard off screen.]
Finn: Huh? Let's go! [runs toward screaming]
Jake: Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.
[Scene changes to Finn running toward the Soft Village. He enters it and sees several Soft People crying.]
Finn: Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
Soft Person #1: The Gut Grinder! He's back!
Finn: The "Gut Grinder?"
Old Soft Person: Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome [laughs]! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?
Finn: Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
Old Soft Person: [crying] Yes, oh, yes!
Finn: Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
Soft Person #1: Swear to what?
Finn: I swear to justice!
Soft People: Whoa! He swears to justice!
Finn: Okay, so, what does he look like?
Old Soft Person: Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But... [walks over to footprint] he left this footprint... [Jake (giant-sized) storms in] Wha--?
Jake: [putting his foot in the print] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Soft Person #1: Look! His paw matches the footprint!
[Soft People start murmuring, terrified.]
Soft Person #1: I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!
Finn: Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
Soft Person #2: [sigh] Thank goodness.
Soft Person #1: Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!
Jake: Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?
Soft Person #1: Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him.
Jake: [loudly] Then I am the Gut Grinder!
Soft Person #1: I'm gonna wee-wee! [squirts liquid out of its armpits and spins around in a circle]
Finn: [laugh] That guy wee-wees weird.
Jake: I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm... [shrinks back to normal size] Jake the Dog! Woohoo!
Soft Person #3: Aw, he's just a cute little dog!
Jake: Hey, I'm not cute!
Soft Child: [running up to Jake] Doggy! [petting Jake] Pet, pet, pet! [laughs]
Jake: Huh? Oh, heheh. [closes his eyes, purrs, drools]
Finn: Pfft.
Jake: What?!
Finn: I didn't say anything. [to villagers] People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!
[Soft People cheer.]
Finn: Come on, let's go, Jake.
Jake: [getting a belly rub] Oh... heheh. What? No! [Finn grabs him and drags him away] Noooo...
Soft Child: Bye-bye, doggy!
Jake: [still being dragged by Finn] Bye, Soft Village.
[Scene changes to Finn and Jake following the footprints. Jake is walking in them.]
Jake: Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? [laughs nervously]
Finn: Dude, your paws'll fit anything.
Jake: [laugh] That is true. Check this out. [shrinks his feet to fit Finn's prints and walks in them; says mockingly:] I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!
Finn: [imitating Jake] I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
Jake: There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
[Commotion is heard in the distance.]
Finn: Huh? [sees that it's coming from Cube Village]
[Scene switches to Finn inside Cube Village.]
Finn: Hey Cube People, what's going on here?
Cube Person #1: The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!
Jake: [emerging from behind a building] Wait, what happened?
Cube People: Aaah! The Gut Grinder!
Finn: Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!
Cube Person #2: We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!
Jake: [laughs nervously] Th-that's ridiculous.
Finn: Jake, back to your normal size.
Jake: Oh yeah. [shrinks down, starts dancing] Ooh ooh ooh. [sings] I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh.
Cube Person #1: Aw, he's just a cute little dog.
Jake: Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot.
Cube Person #1: Aw, look--he's all mad!
Cube Person #2: Even cuter.
Jake: Aaah!
Cube Person #1: [running over to Jake] So cute! [hugs him, rubs his belly] Aw, so cute, so cute!
Jake: I'm not cute! I'm--mnh, [closes eyes] ooh.
Finn: We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like.
Cube Person #2: Exactly like him, [points to Jake] but bigger.
Jake: [getting belly rubbed] Ruff, ruff, grrrr... [continues making dog sounds]
Finn: Huh... Which way did he go?
[Cube People point left.]
Finn: Jake! Hey, come on!
Jake: Wha--? [getting up] Where am I?
Finn: [running left] Thanks, guys!
Jake: [following Finn] I'm not cute. I'll mess you up.
[Scene changes to Finn riding Jake through a field.]
Jake: Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?
Finn: What?!
Jake: What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?
Finn: You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
Jake: Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man.
Finn: I can't help it. I take pictures.
Jake: Well, when do you sleep?
Finn: Justice never sleeps.
Jake: Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!
Finn: [into Jake's ear] You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
Jake: [worried moan]
[An alarm starts sounding. Finn and Jake see that it is coming from the Spiky Village.]
Alarm: City in danger! City in danger!
Finn: Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm... [snaps fingers] Ah-ha! [reaches into his pack] Got the perfect thing for ya: [pulls out glasses] Groucho glasses! [places glasses on a lump of Jake's fat]
Jake: I love it! [kisses lump, hides his face by moving it to his chest] Launch in 3, 2, 1! [jumps toward Spiky Village]
Finn: Woohoo! Yeah!
[They enter Spiky Village. Several Spiky People are seen crying.]
Finn: Oh, man! These people are a mess!
Spiky Guard: Halt! Identify yourselves immediately!
Finn: I am Finn the hero!
Jake: [moving lump] I'm Groucho!
Finn: We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
Spiky Guards: [gasp]
Spiky Mayor: I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.
Finn: I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
Spiky Mayor: Our people thank you. I present to you this photo [Spiky Person enters carrying a photograph] of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.
Finn: [takes photo] Oh, thanks.
Jake: [quietly] Wha--? [looking at photo] Finn, it's me!
Finn: [crumbles photo into a ball; says quietly:] Well, duh, it looks like you. [puts photo in pocket] We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face.
Jake: Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. [starts shaking nervously]
Finn: Jake, stop it!
[Jake accidentally shakes off the Groucho glasses.]
Spiky Mayor: Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!
[Spiky People start murmuring angrily and surround Finn and Jake.]
Finn: No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!
[Jake bats his eyelids.]
Spiky Mayor: His face is weird. The truth is obvious: your friend is the Gut Grinder!
[Spiky People take Jake.]
Finn: NOOOOOO!
Spiky Mayor: [as Spiky People put Jake in jail.] You are under arrest for stealing our gold.
Finn: [running up to Jake] I'll get you out of here... somehow.
Jake: No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.
Finn: Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!
Jake: Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.
Old Man Prisoner: I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder. [catches a grub] I'm here for the free grub. [puts grub in his mouth] Hehehehehe! [his gold tooth gleams]
Finn: Huh? Wait, I got an idea!
[Finn reaches through the bars and pulls out the old man's tooth and runs to the middle of town, holding up the tooth.]
Finn: Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!
[A manhole cover rattles nearby. Out pops a cute dog face.]
Finn: Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?
[The face shoots out sharp points and rises up. It turns out to be a mace held by the Gut Grinder, who climbs out of the manhole. The Gut Grinder growls and sees the gold tooth in Finn's hand. He chases Finn, punches him, and steps on him, taking the tooth and laughing. The scene switches to inside the jail.]
Old Man Prisoner: [rubbing Jake's belly] Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder... you're a little cutesy. You're a little cutesy-wootsy.
Jake: Huh? Grrrr... not cute. [thinking] Am I the Gut Grinder? [looks through bars at Gut Grinder stepping on Finn] All the clues fit! [sees gold tooth] I must be the Gut Grinder! [as Gut Grinder, aloud] And I want GOLD!
[Jake grows huge, breaks out of jail, runs over to the Gut Grinder and kicks him, sending the gold tooth into the air.]
Finn: [catching tooth] Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake!
Jake: [as Gut Grinder] Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!
Finn: What? Jake? [Jake chomps at him] Whoa!
[Finn runs away and accidentally rips his pack on a spike, spilling its contents. Jake corners him.]
Finn: [panting] Whoa!
Jake: [as Gut Grinder] Rawr! Now give me that tooth!
Finn: If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!
Jake: [snatches tooth, tosses it into his mouth, and laughs while walking away]
Finn: What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, "Not now, Finn. I have a headache." Oh, Jake, [picks up viola] your viola is all I have now. [plays it screechily]
Jake: [as Gut Grinder] Huh? [comes back] Ah, stay away from my viola!
Finn: Jake, you remember your viola!
Jake: [as Gut Grinder] I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says. [shakes head; normal voice] Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?
Finn: Who else would it be, baby?
Jake: Whoo! [shrinks to normal size] I guess I went nuts.
Finn: You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy.
Jake: [burps up tooth, laughs]
Finn: [patting Jake's back] It's good to have you back.
Jake: It's good to have you pat my back.
Finn: [scratching Jake] Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream.
Jake: [pushes Finn away] Cut it out!
[Scene changes to Gut Grinder. Spiky People surround it.]
Spiky Person: Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly!
[Something starts moving inside the Gut Grinder. It rips open and gold spills out.]
Spiky Mayor: What the--? [Sharon comes out of the pile of gold] What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?
Spiky People: [murmuring] That's the mayor's wife!
Spiky Mayor: [holding skin] And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?!
Sharon: [unapologetically] Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold.
Spiky Mayor: WHY, SHARON?!
Sharon: Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot.
[Spiky People gasp. Jake raises his eyebrows up and down.]
Spiky Mayor: You have been a naughty girl, Sharon. [turns to guards] Guards! Throw my wife in jail. [turns to Finn and Jake] Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village.
Finn: [gives thumbs up] No problem, mayor.
Spiky Mayor: Now give us a hug.
[Spiky People laugh and advance toward Finn and Jake.]
Finn: No, don't do that! Don't hug us! [Spiky People start hugging] Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!
Jake: Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW!
[The episode opens with Finn and Jake standing on an abandoned highway. Jake stretches himself and Finn down, and they enter a cave.]
Finn: Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.
[Marceline opens the door.]
Finn: Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
Marceline: Woot! Woot!
Jake: Woo!
[Finn and Jake enter the house. A trio of ghosts float in the living room.]
Marceline: Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.
Finn: Whatup?
Marceline: Guys, this is Wendy...
Wendy: Hey.
Marceline: Booboo...
Booboo: Hello. Hello.
Marceline: ...and Georgy.
Georgy: Hey.
Marceline: We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.
Finn: Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
[Finn and Jake jump backwards onto the couch, and find out that it's hard as a rock.]
Finn: [groans in pain] What is wrong with this couch?
Jake: Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.
Marceline: Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.
Finn: Aww, what? man, no fair.
Marceline: Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...
Finn: Wait! Hold on just a second.
[Jake and Finn start whispering to each other.]
Finn: Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
Marceline: All right, all right. Fine.
Finn and Jake: Yes!
Wendy: Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?
Marceline: [giggles] Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. [She whispers to the ghosts. Finn and Jake are exhausted from jumping up and down.]
Finn: Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
Marceline: Okay, hold that thought. [She floats into the next room.]
Georgy: Huhuuuhhuh...
[Marceline floats back into the living room.]
Marceline: I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.
[Marceline lifts up Finn's hat, to reveal his neck. She then makes a hissing noise as she moves closer. Then she pinches Finn's neck. Finn lets out a screech.]
Marceline: Bite.
[Then Marceline does the same thing to Jake.]
Marceline: Chomp.
[Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo all giggle. Marceline puts a dab of ketchup on two of her fingertips and touches Finn and Jake so it looks like they've actually been bitten.]
Marceline: Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?
Finn: Pretty... much... the same.
Jake: My neck sort of hurts.
Booboo: Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?
Finn: [moaning] I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
Jake: Yeah, I could go for some blood.
[Marceline and her ghostly buddies are all snickering in the background.]
Finn: [gasps] Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
Jake: [gasps] Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.
[Marceline floats by, carrying two apples.]
Marceline: Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look. [She drains the red from the apple until it is pale.] You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. [She hands the other apple to Jake.]
[Jake bites the apple, but gets mush all over himself and Finn.]
Finn: Ugh. Come on.
Jake: Sorry, bro. [While Finn and Jake aren't looking, Marceline silently drains the red from the apple in Jake's hands. After Jake and Finn finish rubbing the mush off their faces, Jake looks down and notices the now-pale fruit.] Oh, snap! I feel... stronger. [Jake squeezes the pale apple between his hands.]
Finn: Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
Marceline: Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.
Georgy: Huhuuuhhuh...
[Everyone else glares at Georgy. His cheeks flush.]
Marceline: Think you chumps can handle it?
Finn and Jake: Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah.
[The scene cuts to everyone standing outside in a forest at night.]
Marceline: Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning... [Catches a firefly and puts it in her mouth.] ...invisibility. [She turns invisible. Finn reaches out to touch the firefly in her mouth and chuckles nervously]
Finn: [nervous chuckle]
Marceline: Ah! Hey! [She slaps Finn but catches him before he hits the ground. Marceline moves Finn around. She becomes visible once again.]
Marceline: You ready for the power of...invisibility?
Finn: With all my heart.
Marceline: Good. Now, spin!
[Marceline sends Finn spinning around until he falls to the ground, feeling dizzy. Jake laughs.]
Marceline: Give it a whirl, Jake! [Then she sends Jake spinning until he falls to the ground.] Now chant, "INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!"
Finn and Jake: INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE! [They spin to a stop. They get up groaning dizzily.]
Marceline: Yup. It worked?
Finn and Jake: [gasp]
Jake: We're invisible! [He punches Finn in the stomach.]
Finn: You're invisible! [He punches Jake in the stomach.]
Jake: Hey. Then how come we can see each other?
Marceline: Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.
Finn and Jake: AWW YEAH! [They do a stomach five, and spin around, laughing.]
Booboo: [laughs] Marceline...you're friends with some real morons. [Georgy and Wendy grimace.]
[Finn and Jake happen upon a place deep in the woods where Lumpy Space Princess is camping out.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.
Jake: Wow! LSP's a hobo!
Finn: Let's mess with her.
Lumpy Space Princess: I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.
[Finn and Jake start making moaning sounds, while picking up some of LSP's camping supplies.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!
Finn: [gasps] She knows it's us.
Jake: She must recognize our voices.
Finn: Let's disguise them. [Romanian accent] We're invisible!
[Finn and Jake continue to mess around the campsite.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go! [hangs up]
[Marceline, Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo are all watching close by. They start to snicker as they do. LSP starts chasing them.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Give it back, you guys!
Jake: Weeeee!
[He lets loose a roll of toilet paper, and it wraps around Finn's eyes, blindfolding him.]
Finn: Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
[Because Finn is blindfolded, he can't see where he's going, and his foot unintentionally knocks into the can of baked beans.]
Lumpy Space Princess: [in slow motion] Nooooooooo!
[Time seems to pass in slow motion as the baked beans spill all over the ground.]
Lumpy Space Princess: MY BEANS!!! [Angrily, she hits Finn and Jake. Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo laugh at the sight.]
Booboo: Time to join in on the fun!
Lumpy Space Princess: You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn: But we're undead. [An axe suddenly appears to float in midair. LSP suddenly gasps and faints at the sight.]
Jake: Geez, we really scared her.
[Finn and Jake gasp as Marceline appears behind them.]
Marceline: Nice vampire scare, guys.
Finn: Thanks.
[Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo appear.]
Booboo: Yeah, pretty good, fellas. [The ghosts chuckle.] You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? [They all stick out what would be a foot. Marceline stares.]
Finn: You know we are.
Booboo: Good. [The ghosts all start kicking Finn and Jake.]
Finn: Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
Georgy: Kick 'em harder! [They do so. Bruises appear on Finn and Jake as they yelp in pain.]
Finn: Ow! It hurts!
Jake: Ohhh!
[Marceline decides she's had enough.]
Marceline: Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson!
Georgy: What?
Marceline: Finn, Jake. You guys okay?
[Finn and Jake are all covered in bumps and bruises.]
Finn: We're okay. [coughs] It's all worth it.
Georgy: See? They're fine.
Wendy: When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. [Marceline stares.]
Georgy: Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. [He glances up towards some derelict structures in the distance.]
Finn: Cool.
Marceline: [gasps] W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
Finn: Heh heh. No way.
Jake: We wanna fly!
[The ghosts take them away. Marceline growls in anger and floats after them.]
Marceline: You guys stop right now.
Georgy: Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. [to Finn and Jake] Now, get in your flying positions. [Georgy pushes them off the edge.]
Finn and Jake: VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!
Marceline: What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
Wendy: We do. It's to let them die! [The ghosts start laughing.]
[Marceline is furious. Her eyes blaze with rage. Then she dives off the edge after Finn and Jake, turns invisible, and catches them just before they land on some jagged glass at the bottom. Finn and Jake cheer on all the while. Marceline, still unseen, drops the two of them safely on the ground.]
Finn and Jake: We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome!
[Marceline turns visible again. The ghosts float up to her looking not too satisfied.]
Wendy: Way to go, Marceline.
Marceline: Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!
Booboo: They gotta die someday.
Wendy: Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...
Wendy, Booboo and Georgy: We'll suck their guts out through their brains!
[Marceline and the ghosts float over to Finn and Jake.]
Finn: Did you see us?
Wendy: Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
Booboo: Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.
Finn: Holy snaps, that's awesome!
Marceline: They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
Finn, Jake, and ghosts: What?
Booboo: She's just jealous of you.
[Wendy hands Finn and Jake an envelope.]
Wendy: We'll see you at midnight at our place. [The ghosts turn invisible. Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline.]
Marceline: Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
Finn: We're not gonna go.
Marceline: You're not?
Finn: Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
Marceline: Oh. Okay.
Finn: Well, we're going back home.
Jake: Peace.
[The scene transitions to Jake and Finn standing in the Spooky Forest. Lightning flashes across the night sky. A run-down manor stands on top of the hill.]
Finn: Number 25, Blood Drive. [Finn and Jake enter the mansion.] Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
[Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo have changed. They have significantly increased in size, are wearing laced collars, and have menacing eyes and puckered lips. Georgy closes the door. Then the ghosts join hands, spin around our heroes, and start chanting ominously. Their eyes and mouths start glowing white.]
Finn: Uh... [He shrieks in horror as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head. Jake tries to punch the ghosts' mouths away, but one gets him from behind.] Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
Jake: I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
Finn: Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! [Finn leaps in the air, but gets knocked away and lands on top of the chandelier.]
Georgy: Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?
Wendy: You know you're not even real vampires.
Finn: Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy? [realizes] Oh. [The chandelier breaks loose. finn falls screaming to the floor.] Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
Jake: Yeah.
[The ghosts' mouths start to close in on our heroes when Marceline suddenly appears out of nowhere.]
Marceline: VAMPIRE KICK!!! [She kicks the ghosts' mouths away.] Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
Finn: It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
Marceline: Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.
Finn: Aw, man. [The ghosts' mouths pick up Jake and Finn and start sucking on their heads.] I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature. [Suddenly, the ghosts drop Finn.]
Georgy: Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature?
[The scene cuts to a clip from the movie Heat Signature. A Commander and Private are inside a submarine, looking at a scanner.]
Commander: Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?
Private: Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain.
Commander: Well, spit it out, man!
Private: I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.
[The scene reverts back to Marceline's living room. Marceline and the ghosts are watching in awe while Finn and Jake struggle about on the uncomfortable furniture, looking none too pleased.]
Finn: [groans in frustration] This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
Georgy: MMM-HMM. After the movie.
Finn: Well, can't we just--
Marceline and ghosts: Shhh!
Georgy: Shut!
Private: [off screen] Look out, Commander!
Commander: [off screen] Aaaagh! My heat signature!
[Marceline's face and the ghost's faces suddenly snap to a satisfied smile. The episode ends.]
[The episode begins in an area filled with bones where Finn and Jake are playing.]
Finn: Hahahaha! Here I go!
Jake: Yeah!
Finn: [Sliding down skeleton] Whoo-hoo!!
[Finn hits the ground, and he, Jake, and many bones are propelled into the air. Marceline watches them discreetly.]
Marceline: Hmm...
[Finn and Jake land.]
Finn: Awesome! [He and Jake laugh. Suddenly, crying is heard.] Someone needs our help!
[Finn runs to the source of the crying. Jake spits out a bone and follows. They find Marceline talking to an old man.]
Marceline: [To her henchman] What is it about "henchman for life" that you don't understand?
Old Man Henchman: Oh, come on!
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!
[Jake screams and cowers in fear.]
Old Man Henchman: Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body?
Marceline: "Henchman for life" means, "henchman for life!!"
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] You still petrified of vampires?
[Jake's head has sunk into his body.]
Jake: [Prevaricating] No... I'm not...
Marceline: [To old man] Fall on the ground for me!
Old Man Henchman: Yes, Mistress. [He does so.]
Marceline: Now cry for me!
Old Man Henchman: Okay. I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you. [He begins weeping.]
Finn: [Running from behind bushes] Hey! Cut that out!
Marceline: Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!
Finn: Stop making this poor old dude cry!
Marceline: I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me.
[The old man balances himself on his cane.]
Finn: Stop it!
Marceline: Now hop around in a circle.
[The old man hops around on his cane. The tip breaks and he falls down.]
Finn: Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free.
Marceline: Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?
Finn: I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place!
Jake: Dude, what?!
Marceline: Do you mean it?
Finn: Uh... well... [He looks at the old man who is groaning tiredly.] Heck yeah!
Marceline: Deal! Old henchman, you're free.
Old Man Henchman: Whoo-hoo! [Leaps off happily]
Jake: What're you doing, man?
Marceline: Hey, Jake.... BLEH!! [She makes a horrific face.]
Jake: EEH! [Grabs onto Finn]
Finn: I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it.
Marceline: [Laughs] [Mocking Finn] "Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it." [Cackles]
Jake: Rrrr... HEY!
Marceline: Yes, Jake? [Transforms into a werewolf creature] What would you like to talk about?!
Jake: AAAH! [Runs to Finn's side] I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave.
Finn: I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my [Taken by Marceline into the air] WOOOOORD!!
Jake: FINN! [Marceline cackles as they fly into the air.] Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!!
[Scene transition; Marceline and Finn are flying through the air.]
Marceline: You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.
Finn: [Gasps; to himself] Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!
[They arrive at a house that has music playing and a person singing.]
Marceline: Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door. [Finn walks up to the door and strains himself.] OPEN IT ALREADY!
Finn: No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!
Marceline: Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?
Finn: I... [Sighs] Yes... [Turns and walks towards door]
[Inside, the man is still playing. The door is opened and the draft blows the candles out.]
Eberhardt: Huh?
Finn: Sorry about this.
Eberhardt: [Scared] Haah!
Marceline: Hold him down! [Finn groans. Marceline and Finn enter and close the door behind them. Jake appears and comes to the window.] Are you enjoying this, Finn?
Finn: No!
[Marceline laughs.]
Jake: [To himself] Rrr... Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. I've got a perfect plan! [Marceline laughs. She notices Jake through the window and hisses at him, turning into a lizard creature.] AAH! [Running from window] I'm not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan!!
Eberhardt: Please, human boy! Let me go!
Finn: I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says.
Eberhardt: I understand, son. I was married myself once. [A single tear drops from his right eye.]
Finn: Wait, wait! I'm not married to—
Marceline: [Frustrated] Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!
Finn: No! [Pulls Eberhardt away before Marceline could bite him; Marceline attacks again.] No! [Pulls him away again]
Marceline: How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed!
[Marceline blasts Finn's arms with a red beam, making them curl up and become immobile. She laughs, hisses and bites Eberhardt. Eberhardt screams.]
Finn: NOOOOO!!!
[Marceline is revealed to have only been sucking Eberhardt's crimson bow tie.]
Marceline: Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious!
Finn: [Grunts] Huh? [Arms uncurl]
Marceline: What's wrong, Finn?
Finn: I... I thought you were—
Eberhardt: Oh, my! A white tie! Thank you so much! This is so beautiful! [Passes out]
Finn: B-but...
Marceline: What? You know I eat the color red sometimes. [Winks]
Finn: Oh... Yeah... Okay...
[Scene transition; they are flying through the air again.]
Marceline: We've got plenty more evil to do! [Laughs]
Finn: [Thinking] Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what.
Marceline: Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?
Finn: Huh? No!
[The two arrive at a graveyard.]
Marceline: I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead. [Finn whimpers.] Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back! [The dead bodies rise out of the ground. ("Eeehhh... What's happening? Eh...")] Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!
Finn: Uhh, NEVER! [A skeleton grabs Finn's rear end.] Okay! I'll do it!
[Marceline laughs. Jake appears in the bushes.]
Jake: [To himself] Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!! [Charges out of bushes with a stake towards Marceline]
Marceline: Huh? What's that noise?
[Marceline turns around. As she does, Jake shrinks down and retreats.]
Jake: [To himself] Sorry, Finn.
[The scene shifts to the Duchy of Nuts where Finn and Marceline are walking towards the Duke of Nuts' castle with an undead army following behind them.]
Marceline: Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?
Finn: [Faking] Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar! [Runs hurriedly]
Marceline: Hahaha!
[Finn knocks on the door. Lisby answers.]
Lisby: Yeeees? Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence!
Finn: My boss is gonna sack your castle!
Lisby: Oh! Well, that's certainly bad news for us!
Duke of Nuts: Lisby! Who's at the door?
Lisby: Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle!
Duke of Nuts: Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM!
Finn: No! [The army draws closer.] Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead!
Duke of Nuts: Oh! How wonderful!
Finn: Listen to me!! [The army arrives.] EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
Marceline: Hahaha! [She flies into the palace.] I wrote this next song about a fisherman. [She sings the Fisherman Song.]
Finn: Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you!
Marceline: Don't do what?
Duke of Nuts: You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music!
Finn: Wha?!
Lisby: Oh, I forgot! Marceline is playing tonight!
[Marceline plays her bass. Everyone starts partying.]
Finn: Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or... [Sighs] I'm over-reacting.
Lisby: Hey!
Finn: Huh?
Lisby: Why are you thinking so hard?! Just party hard! Whoo!
Finn: Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha!
Marceline: Hey, castle-crasher!
Finn: Hey, Marceline!
Marceline: You like cute things, right?
Finn: Uh, yeah, sure. Why?
Marceline: Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever!
Finn: Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool!
Marceline: Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens.
Finn: [He does so. Finn gains a dimple.] Hahaha! A dimple!
Marceline: Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something.
Finn: What is it?
Marceline: I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!
Finn: What?!
Marceline: [Pulling it out] Use my ax bass.
[Scene shifts to outside where Finn is holding the guitar and standing in front of the plant.]
Finn: I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy... [Finn lifts up the ax and hesitates. He throws down the guitar.] AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!
Marceline: [Entering] There is no twist. Kill it now!
Finn: But wh—
[The plant turns into a monster.]
Marceline: You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...
Finn: I-I thought— [The monster attacks Finn, but he evades the attack. He rolls, jumps towards the dimple plant monster and cuts one of its limbs. It sprays juice which Finn accidentally catches in his mouth. It makes him gain dozens of dimples. He spits the juice out.] Sick!!
[The monster grabs Finn and eats him.]
Marceline: Oh, boy... [She simply detaches one of its limbs to kill the monster. Finn axes himself free.] Not bad... for a henchman.
Finn: [Smiling] Hmm...
[The scene shifts to the next morning. Finn and Marceline are in a strawberry patch.]
Finn: Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you?
Marceline: Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?
Finn: Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage.
[They both laugh.]
Marceline: Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies.
Finn: Yeah, sure. That sounds good.
Marceline: Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil.
Finn: I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!
Marceline: [Breaking] What are you talking about? I... [Laughs] Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!
Finn: [Laughs] I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?
Marceline: Oh, just an old diving buddy. [Jake emerges from the bushes.] [Jokingly] So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?
Finn: Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man.
Jake: [To himself] Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! [Yelling out] Die, unholy thing! [Throws garlic at her]
Finn: Jake?
Marceline: [The garlic hits her.] Ow! [She drops her umbrella and hisses loudly as she stares at the sun. She moans as she falls on the ground and withers.]
Finn: Marceline!
Jake: I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!
Finn: She's alright, man!
Jake: She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!
Finn: I can't let you do that, Jake!
Jake: [Sighs deeply] I love you, brother. YAAAH! [Attacks Finn, forcing him to the ground]
Finn: Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!
Jake: What are you even talkin' about, dude?!
[Marceline crawls under the umbrella.]
Finn: Oh, man! [Kicks Jake off his person]
[As Finn runs towards the umbrella, Jake smacks him away.]
Jake: MARCELINE! [Jake stakes the umbrella. As he lifts it, there's nothing but smoke and wailing is heard.] Where is she?!
Finn: [Faking] I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!
Jake: I did?! I did! Yeah! [singing] I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!! [Runs away and laughs triumphantly.]
[Finn holds up the umbrella. Marceline (as a bat) comes out of Finn's pack.]
Marceline: [Whispering] Is it cool?
Finn: Yup!
Marceline: Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!
Finn: That's what henchmen are for.
Marceline: Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you.
Finn: We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?
Marceline: [Flying away with the umbrella] Definitely.
Jake: You want some more eggs, BMO?
BMO: Yes, please.
Jake: [Gives BMO more eggs] How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill?
Finn: I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange. [Tries to move food in his stomach but fails] Nope. Can't do it.
Jake: I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.
Finn: Sometimes it helps.
Jake: Can't argue with that! [Relaxes] Ahh...
Finn: [Relaxing] Ahh...
BMO: [Moving arms up] Ahh...
[Telephone rings and Jake groans.]
Jake: [Answering] Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. [Hangs up]
Finn: Lady Rainicorn again?
Jake: Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.
Finn: Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
Jake: No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram. [Begins writing] Mm-hmm. [He finishes and sends the message. The reply comes within seconds.]
Finn: What's it say?
Jake: Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves. [The crystal shoots a beam into his head.] Ahh... They're into it, dude!
Finn: Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
[Scene shifts to Finn and Jake's bedroom.]
Finn: Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
Jake: Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.
Finn: There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
Jake: Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.
Finn: Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
Jake: ...Nah. That could never happen.
Finn: You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
Jake: AAAH! I'M A MORON!
Finn: Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
Jake: I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.
[Finn whispers to Jake; in the next scene they can be seen painting the treasure room and singing The Decorating Song, while Jake morphs himself into a rainicorn.]
Finn: Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
Jake: You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.
Finn: Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
Jake: [Worried] No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then— [Doorbell rings] Huh?!
Ethel: Jake?
Jake: AAAAH... [To Finn] LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!
[Bob rings the doorbell two more times, then he and his wife look at each other.]
Bob: [Knocking] Hello? [they have universal translators]
Jake: 안녕하세요. ("Hello.")
Ethel: Jake, is that you?
Jake: Uh-huh.
Ethel: Are you going to let us in?
Jake: Y-yeeeaaah... [Opens door]
Ethel: AAAAAAHHHH!!!
Jake: I can explain!! I can explain!!
Ethel: OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!
Jake: You think I'm a rainicorn?
Bob: I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.
Ethel: Well, we are a little blind.
Bob: Yes, I guess we are a little blind.
Jake: Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!
Ethel: Your house is very colorful. I like that!
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] Haha! The plan is working, homie!
Bob: Jake, what is that thing that's talking?
Jake: Uh... that's um...
Finn: I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance! [Starts chanting and dancing]
Bob: Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!
Jake: Uh... y-yes! [To Finn] Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!
Finn: But—
Jake: [Whispering] Come on, homie, help me!
Finn: [Smiles] [Whispering] Ha! You got it, homie!
Jake: Uh... please, c-come upstairs.
[Scene shifts to the living room.]
Jake: My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.
Bob: Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.
Ethel: Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter.
Bob: Ethel...
Jake: Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!
Ethel: I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd.
Jake: Well... he's actually a human.
Ethel: Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!
Bob: Shh. [To Jake] Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!
Jake: Uh... No problem, Bob!
Ethel: Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!
Bob: Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp? [Note: the name is pronounced with blowing a small raspberry at the end.]
Jake: Uh, s-say it again?
Bob: Cameladabalawabapp!
Jake: Ohhhh! [Laughs] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! I thought you said "Kabloderaga—[Blows raspberry]"! [Chuckles] Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! Ha! Y'all should go first, though.
Bob: Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!! [Fires a beam from his horn at the wall, which turns red.]
Ethel: Oh, Bob!
Bob: Haha! Your turn, Jake!
Jake: I...
Finn: [Entering] Snacks! Get your snacks!
Jake: [To himself] Finn! [Whispering to him] Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!
Finn: Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
Jake: You're the best, homie.
Finn: Homies help homies.
Jake: Haha! [He steps back and Finn breathes in and holds his breath, then gives a thumbs-up.] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]!
[Jake stretches his "horn" at Finn. Finn's face begins to turn red from holding his breath. Finn falls over and releases his breath. Ethel and Bob applaud Jake.]
Ethel: Very unusual color palette, Jake.
Bob: Yes. Subtle.
Jake: Whoo! Oh, yeah! [Finn is breathing heavily on the floor.] Finn?
Bob: How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?
Jake: I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!
Bob and Ethel: Let the games begin!
[Musical montage begins. Bob and Ethel begin flying. Jake "flies" by having Finn carry him.]
Jake: [Whispering to Finn] I'm sorry.
[Finn scowls. Next, Ethel, Bob, and Jake wrestle with their horns. Ethel charges into Finn from behind and knocks him down; she and Bob laugh. Finn looks at Jake who just shrugs helplessly. Next, Finn is places on a coiled-up Ethel, who suddenly juts out like a spring, sending Finn flying off into a glass bottle. Bob places Finn on a coiled-up Jake who does the same, reluctantly. Finn falls through the ceiling of the living room in the Tree Fort.]
Jake: [To the parents] Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im! [Jake enters the fort panting.] Hey, man. How's it goin'?
Finn: [Angry] IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW!
Jake: I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!
Finn: Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
Jake: Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie. [He smiles at Finn who is still making an angry face.] Homies help homies. [Finn smiles.] [Ethel and Bob enter laughing.] Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?
Ethel: Oh, no, we're pooped.
Bob: Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!
Jake: Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. [Whispering to Finn] Homie... help me cook something, please.
Finn: ...Okay.
Jake: Thanks, Finn. [To Ethel and Bob] Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.
Bob: What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!
Ethel: Ah! I was hoping! [Laughs] I was afraid to ask!
[Ethel and Bob gather around Finn. Bob rips off Finn's shirt.]
Finn: WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
Ethel: Of course we do! Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"!
Finn: JAKE! COME ON!
Jake: [Panicking] Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....
[Bob bites Finn's stomach.]
Finn: AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!! [Punches him]
Ethel: [Punching Finn] Don't you touch him!!
[The three continue fighting.]
Jake: Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop! [Growls angrily then grows huge] NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend! [Ethel and Bob gasp.] I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady! [To himself] But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. [Retracts to his default form]
Ethel: [Gasps] You're a dog?
Jake: Yeah, I just... [Groans] Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was—
Bob: YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!
[Ethel and Bob celebrate by singing "The Lucky Ones," dancing, and hugging Jake.]
Jake: Uh... uh... [Gasps] Lady?!
Lady Rainicorn: 어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! ("Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!")
Finn: What did she say?
Jake: She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!
Finn: J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
[Lady hands Finn a photo.]
Jake: Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!
Finn: Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
[Scene shifts to outside the fort. Everyone is having a picnic.]
Ethel: Finn.
Finn: [Stops staring at his food] ...Wha?
Ethel: Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you.
Bob: It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.
Finn: Oh.
Jake: So... this isn't human?
Ethel: Oh, no. This is soy people!
Finn: Oh.
Ethel: I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!
[Finn touches his food, which begins to secrete a strange liquid.]
Jake: Ew... Soy? [Eats some and smiles] FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!
[Finn disconcertedly watches the rest of the group eat. He stares at his food and cautiously puts some of it in his mouth. He smiles and the episode ends.]
[The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and the Swamp Giant falling from a great height. They are both gripping onto the giant.]
Swamp Giant: AAAAH!
Finn: Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
Swamp Giant: NEVER!!
[The three scream as they fall. Squeaking is heard.]
Finn: Huh? [He finds the Mini Queen.] Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
Jake: Then hold my hand, dude! [Finn does so.] Whoooop!
[Jake inflates, making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground.]
Swamp Giant: Aaaah! Oof!
[The swamp giant hits the ground. Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant. Jake lets his air out and deflates.]
Finn: My inflatable angel.
Jake: Heh heh heh. [They jump off the giant.] How's the Mini Queen?
Finn: I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. [The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn's hand that says, "THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME, XOXO CALL ME." The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart.] Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! [Finn performs a "handshake" with one of her antennae. She squeaks.] Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
[The Mini Queen jumps on Jake's nose and then leaps away.]
Jake: [Sniffs] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a sword.] Whoa!
Finn: What?
Jake: [In awe] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Finn: Billy?!
Finn and Jake: [Singing] BIIILLYYYYYY!!!
[Flashback]
Young Billy: Nothung!
[The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically. The musical sequence begins.]
[Back in the present]
Finn: Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!
Jake: Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!
Finn: This is so cool!
[He attempts to pull out the sword. The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear.]
Finn and Jake: Whoa!
Finn: It's Billy's legendary crack!
[They go inside. They gasp as they are treated with Billy's presence.]
Billy: [Sighs] Hello.
Finn: [Whispering to Jake] It's him! It's him!!
Jake: [Whispering] I know, I know! Be cool!!
Billy: Yep. It's me.
Finn: Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
Billy: What for?
Finn: So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
Jake: I wanna be the dog version of you!
Billy: Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.
Jake: Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
Billy: No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.
Jake: Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.] Ah... ah...
Finn: What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!
Billy: You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [Finn gasps.] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.
[Billy points to his skeleton of a dog.]
Jake: [Scared, yet smiling] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [Falls backward]
Billy: All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [Deep sigh] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!
Jake: What other way is there?
Billy: Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Finn: Nonviolently?? [Sighs] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
Jake: Me, too!
Finn: Billy, I won't let you down!
Jake: I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!
[They run away screaming. Billy sighs wearily. The scene shifts to the Grass Lands. Finn is riding on Jake.]
Finn: This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
Jake: Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
Cobbler: Help! Help! [Finn and Jake notice his cries.] A monster! [The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts.] Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!
Finn: Oh, uh...
Jake: Oh...
Cobbler: Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
Jake: [Straightforward] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
Cobbler: No, but please! [Stammers frantically]
Finn: [To Jake] Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Jake: I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
Finn: [To cobbler] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
Cobbler: Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
Jake: Say no more. [Walking away, pulling Finn with him] Come on, Finn.
Cobbler: Where're you going?!
Jake: To make you somethin' to eat!
[They leave. The dragon arrives.]
Cobbler: AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
[The dragon attacks him by breathing fire. The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand.]
Finn: I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Jake: Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [Yelling out] Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Lady: [Walking up to stand] What's this all about?
Finn: Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
Lady: Hahaha! [Eats gruel] I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.
Finn: [Victoriously] YEAH!!!
[Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake's gruel.]
Finn: This is great, Jake!
Jake: Yeah, we're really helpin' people!
Finn: Whoa! Look who it is!
[The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake. There are scorch marks on him.]
Jake: Dude! You're alive!
Cobbler: [Angrily] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [Unsure] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—
[Jake shushes him.]
Jake: [Deliberate] Dude. Gruel.
Cobbler: Oh, thank you! [Eats it] Hahahaha! Hahaha. [His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone.] AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
Finn: Huh? [Holds up glass with potion in it] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
Cobbler: Wha? Ah... uh?!
[More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics.]
Jake: Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
[Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles. The townspeople have grown armor as well. One of the townspeople's belly button starts shooting flames.]
Townsperson: AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!
Finn: [To Jake] Geez... I thought people would like that.
Cobbler: Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
Finn: So you can defend against evil monsters!
Cobbler: You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
Finn: No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
Cobbler: Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
Finn: Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
Finn and Jake: [Thinking] Hmmmmmm...
Cobbler: WHAT?! NO—
[Cut to the shoe-repair shop.]
Finn: Alright! We're cobblers!
Cobbler: No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! [Leaving] And don't try to cobble anything!
Jake: [To Finn] What does "cobble" mean, anyway?
Finn: I think it has something to do with shoes...
Fine Lady: [Entering shop] Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.
Finn: [Taking shoe and heel] Of course I'll help!
[Scene transition. Finn is hammering in the heel.]
Finn: There! [Rolling over to lady] Whah! [He puts the shoe on her foot.] Pa-kow!!
Fine Lady: Ah!
[She seems content with the repair. Suddenly, a blade comes out of the shoe. The lady makes a small gasp.]
Finn: Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Jake: [To Finn] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
Finn: Maybe... [The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso.] Whoa!
Jake: Cool!
Fine Lady: I cannot go to the funeral in these!
Cobbler: [Entering shop] Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! [The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler.] WHY?! [The lace forces the cobbler to the ground.]
Fine Lady: [To Finn and Jake] ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.
Cobbler: [To Finn and Jake] GET OUT!!
[Cut to outside the shop.]
Finn: Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
Jake: Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!
Finn: [Frustrated sigh] Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.
Jake: Whoa, what?!
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button: HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!
Finn: Medical help? Hmmmmm...
[The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors.]
Finn: How can we help?
Lumpy Space Princess: I want surgery to make my body hot.
Finn: Yikes...
Lumpy Space Princess: Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.
Jake: [Whistles] [To Finn] You up for some serious plastic surgery?
[The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen.]
[Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body, complete with legs.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! [Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg.] Huh?! Aw, what?! [Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises.]
Jake: Dude, did you use a magic nail again?
Finn: I've got three left!
Lumpy Space Princess: Ohhhh... [She gains a robotic eye.] What did you do to me??
Finn: We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
Lumpy Space Princess: No one thinks this look is hot!!
[The cobbler suddenly walks up.]
Cobbler: [To Lumpy Space Princess] Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— [He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Huh?!
[Her wheel activates, and she speeds into the cobbler. The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming.]
Finn: ...Jake...?
Jake: ....Yeah...?
Finn: I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
Jake: Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!
Finn: I just wanna sit here and moan.
Jake: Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.
Finn: [Moaning] Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
Jake: [Moaning] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
[Finn and Jake notice more cries for help.]
Old Lady: AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!
Swamp Giant: Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!
Old Lady: AAAH! AAAH!
Jake: [To Finn] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [Heroically] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [Weakly] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.
Swamp Giant: It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!
Old Lady: Help!!
[Finn sweats.]
Swamp Giant: Right?!?
[Finn strains, visibly in conflict.]
Old Lady: Oooh!! Aaah!!
[Finn raises his fist.]
Finn: Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
Swamp Giant: [To Old Lady] Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?
Finn: [Furiously] WRONG!!!! [He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady.] [Quietly, to Jake] I couldn't think of anything...
Old Lady: Whooo! [Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms]
Finn: POOP!! I saved her with violence...
Old Lady: What's your huff, son?
Finn: The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
Old Lady: Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! [Punches Finn] Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! [Starts dancing] And don't take advice from old people! [Continues dancing]
Finn: Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
Jake: Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—
Finn: It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
Jake: Cha!!
[Scene transition to Billy's cave.]
Finn: It's us again.
Jake: And we've got exciting news!
Billy: Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.
Finn: Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
Billy: Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
Jake: She's right here. [Turns around, revealing her]
Old Lady: Hello!
[Billy gasps.]
Finn: We saved 'er, Billy.
Jake: You saved 'er.
Finn: I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! [Holds up fists and leg] And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!
Billy: Hmm. Perhaps you're right. [Pained groan] It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? [He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass.] Nothung! [The sword comes back once again.] Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. [They laugh excitedly.] Now you're freakin' me out... [Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically. Finn and Jake are taken off.]
Jake: We're his heroes!!
[Billy looks at the old lady.]
Billy: Huh... Hello.
Jake: Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!
Billy: Get outta here!!
[Finn and Jake run out quickly, laughing heartily. As Finn and Jake happily wander off, Billy nods contentedly. The episode comes to a close.]
[Episode starts in the Breakfast Kingdom. Breakfast Princess is eating breakfast alongside Toast Princess in a bed. Ice King peers at them through a window. He starts laughing.]
Ice King: Good morning, Breakfast Princesses. [He sneakily climbs in through the window. He comes up beside their bed with a jar of honey and a honey dipper. He drips honey on Breakfast Princess's waffles.]
Breakfast Princess: Huh? [Ice King looks up at them, mumbling incoherently and then suddenly frowns.] Sis, give me the phone. [Toast Princess hands her a phone from beside their bed. Breakfast Princess dials a number.] [talking on phone:] Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.
[Finn and Jake barge through a door in the room.]
Finn: Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
Ice King: That's why I'm using honey.
Jake: Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.
Finn: [laughs] Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
Ice King: What? You can't do that!
Finn: You're grounded for two weeks!
Ice King: You're grounded for two weeks!
Finn: [slowly] Three weeks.
Jake: Oh, snaps!
Ice King: Why? I didn't do anything.
Finn: Four weeks?
Ice King: [Ice King slaps his face and drags his hands down to his beard while facing the ceiling. He suddenly looks at Finn.] Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
Finn: That just grounded you for four weeks.
Jake: Oh, dang!
Ice King: [sighs] Okay. [Ice King starts to walk out. He turns back to look at Finn and Jake. Jake gives him the peace sign on both hands while Finn just smiles at him.] What's up with the peace sign?
Jake: Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.
Finn: Get outta here, bubble-butt!
[Ice King runs out while screaming. His butt outline is shown through his clothes. Finn and Jake laugh when he's gone.]
Jake: Awesome. [Finn and Jake knuckle-punch.]
[Scene changes to the Ice Kingdom at night. Ice King is heard screaming. The scene changes to inside Ice King's home.]
Ice King: This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me! [Ice King shakes his head quickly.] I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle. [Ice King taps his crown while closing his eyes in concentration. He gets an idea and goes over to his computer. He starts typing.] [reading what he's typing:] H...I...T...M...A...N. [in his own thoughts:] Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads:
SCORCHER
Hitman - Hits people for you.
QUICK. QUIET. RELENTLESS.
contact]
Ice King: Perfect. [reading what he's typing]
Dear Mr. Scorcher,
I would like you to hit two people. Neat name by the way. Love, the Ice King. [Ice King types out <3 to signify a heart when he says love.]
[The Scorcher appears behind Ice King right after he sent the email. Ice King screams in surprise.]
Ice King: Whoa, you are fast. [The Scorcher looks at him and says nothing.] And quiet. [The Scorcher continues to look at him quietly.] And very good at dramatic silence. I like it. [Ice King gets up from his chair by the computer.] Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or... [The Scorcher's hand lights on fire and Ice King screams in fright. The Scorcher produces a contract from the fires. He hands it to Ice King.] Oh-ho, paperwork! [The contract reads: Who shall I hit?] [reading off what he's writing:] Finn and Jake. [The contract is lit on fire and disappears. The Scorcher emits a black vapor and vanishes, taking the vapor with him. Ice King starts laughing. He flies over to his telescope.] Whoosh! [He looks at Finn and Jake's house. He sees Finn and Jake inside. He also sees the Scorcher outside, looking at them.] A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing? [The Scorcher lights their Tree Fort on fire. The Scorcher then disappears while a fire rages.] What the—?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman! [Ice King flies out of his castle.]
[Scene changes to inside of the Tree Fort. We can see fires raging outside while Finn and Jake are making sandwiches.]
Jake: Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? [Jake's sandwich is almost as big as Jake's face.]
Finn: Mine's whack. [Finn's sandwich has two pieces of lettuce, a tomato, and a slice of cheese.]
Jake: Well, put some meat in there!
Finn: Huh. What kind of meat is that?
Jake: That's Meat Man's meat.
Finn: Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
Jake: I don't know. I can't read his mind.
[Jake is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when Ice King breaks through their wall, spitting ice everywhere, freezing Finn and Jake's tree house. Jake's sandwich gets frozen in a block of ice.]
Jake: [yells:] No!
Ice King: You guys, I—
Finn: What do you think "grounded" means?!
Jake: It's wasted, man.
Finn: Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
Ice King: Okay, okay. Goll. [Ice King leaves]
Finn: It's alright, buddy. We can make another. [Finn puts him arm around Jake to comfort him.]
[Scene switches to Ice King flying to his castle.]
Ice King: Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
[Ice King arrives at his house. The Scorcher hands him a piece of paper.]
Ice King: Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that. [Ice King slaps the paper away.] I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire! [The Scorcher's eyes glow brighter. He runs out while Ice King rambles on.] You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh! [Ice King turns around and doesn't see the Scorcher.] Hey wha—?
[Scene changes back to the Tree Fort. Finn and Jake are asleep.
Finn: [while dreaming:] Punch, punch, punch!
Jake: [while dreaming:] Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. [Jake snores loudly.]
[Suddenly, the Scorcher appears in the middle of the room. He turns into a black vapor and covers everything in the room. He goes inside Finn's and Jake's bodies through their open mouths.
[Scene shows Ice King looking through the window. He gasps and breaks the window open. He blows winds through the room.]
Ice King: Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!
Jake: [while dreaming:] Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. [Jake snores.]
Ice King: Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...[Ice King flies away.]
[Scene changes back to the Ice King's castle. The Scorcher is waiting for the Ice King there.]
Ice King: Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something. [Ice King shows the Scorcher by punching him on the shoulder.] Are you even listening? Oh, I get it. [Ice King pulls out a wad of dollar bills.] Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake. [The Scorcher burns the money while Ice King laughs nervously.] You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad? [Ice King pulls out a deer head mounted to a plaque. He presses a button, and the deer starts singing 'I wanna live live live, I wanna live live live.' The Scorcher burns it.] [yells:] No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest. [The Scorcher burns the goggles off his face.] Oh, come on! [Camera shows two Gunters looking at the Ice King, then the other Gunter, then back at the Ice King.] At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses. [Ice King holds up a picture of Lumpy Space Princess.] What about Lumpy Space Princess? [The Scorcher burns the picture.] Ghost Princess? [Ice King holds up a picture of Ghost Princess.] I can't even hold her with my love mitts. [The Scorcher burns the picture.] Aw, geez! Uh... [The Scorcher makes a fire in front of Ice King's face.] Oh! A—A leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow. [Ice King hops over to a door.] Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back! [Ice King exits.] [Scene changes to room near the entry room of Ice King's castle.] Ow, ow, ow! [Ice King hides beside the door.] Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah! [Ice King pulls out a laptop computer out of his beard.] Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a— [Ice King searches 'Hitman Hitman'.] Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads:
BLASTRONAUT
-#1 SOLUTION FOR ALL HITMAN PROBLEMS!
$99.95!
PLACE ORDER]
Ice King: Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts. [Ice King clicks the place order button. A new page pops up that says 'ENTER TARGET NAME:'.] [reading what he's typing:] Scorcher. [A new page comes up that says 'TARGET ACQURIED'.]
[Scene changes back to main entry room, where Scorcher is reading a book off of Ice King's coffee table. A wall suddenly explodes, and Blastronaut bursts in, shooting lasers everywhere.
[Scene switches back to Ice King, who is looking at the Blastronaut.]
Ice King: Sweet!
[The Scorcher is standing still as the Blastronaut's lasers shoot past him, completely missing him. The Scorcher walks up to the Blastronaut and slices his suit in half with fire. A goblin jumps out of the suit. He runs away, shocking Ice King. Ice King runs out from his hiding spot.]
Ice King: No! Come back, you wussy! [ Ice King realizes the Scorcher is watching him.] Ooh, that was weird. [The Scorcher turns his hand into a fist and lights it on fire.] Was that your friend, or something? [Ice King laughs nervously. The Scorcher only gets angrier. Ice King points above the Scorcher.] Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins! [The Scorcher squints.] Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them. [The Scorcher turns around.] Peace out! [Ice King freezes The Scorcher and flies away. The Scorcher is shown melting his icy chamber.]
[Scene changes to Ice King flying away.]
Ice King: Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
[Scene changes to Tree Fort. Jake is looking out of a window.]
Jake: Hey, Finn, you awake yet?
Finn: [while lying down:] I'm trying.
Jake: I had a dream about Meat Man.
Finn: Oh, yeah?
Jake: I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. [Jake turns around just as Ice King tackles him inside. Finn points to him.]
Finn: You're grounded!
Ice King: I know, but shush!
[Finn stares in silence as Jake slurps his coffee.]
Ice King: Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
Finn and Jake: What?!
Ice King: I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. [Finn and Jake stare at him, wordlessly.] Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
Jake: Good job. Good job, the Ice King.
[The Scorcher breaks into the Tree Fort in a cloud of black vapor.]
Finn: Oh, my life!
[The Scorcher throws a fire ball at Jake, who ducks it. The fire burns a hole in the wall. Jake throws his coffee in the Scorcher's face.]
Jake: C'mon, man, let's get outta here!
[Scene switches to outside of the Tree Fort. Jake grows big to run quickly away with Finn on his back, and Ice King flies away. The Scorcher gets up, turns into a black vapor, and follows them.]
Finn: Jake, do something. He's getting close!
[Jake stretches out a foot to hit the Scorcher. He misses. The Scorcher squints as he summons a giant fire ball. Jake, in his haste, trips over a tree stump. Finn and Jake fall to the ground and look up to see the fire ball hurtling towards them. They hug each other and don't look. Before the fire ball can reach them, Ice King builds a barrier out of ice to protect himself and them.]
Ice King: You alive?
Jake: Uh, I think so.
Ice King: Whew! That was close.
[Suddenly, the ice barrier starts shaking. The Scorcher is shown throwing fire balls at the barrier. Water drips on Jake's head.]
Jake: Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.
Finn: What do we do?
Ice King: [Ice King closes his eyes in concentration. He gets an idea.] Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
Jake: Hey, I'll kill you!
Ice King: No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
Jake: No way, man! [Jake turns his back to the Ice King.] You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.
Finn: Yeah, we don't trust you!
[Ice King zaps them anyway, encapsulating them in ice chunks.]
Ice King: You'll thank me later.
[Scene switches to outside. Ice King breaks open the dome.]
Ice King: [to the Scorcher:] Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! [Ice King starts hitting Finn's ice chunk.] Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
[The Scorcher squints. He melts Finn's ice chunk to feel his pulse on his arm. The Scorcher nods.]
Ice King: So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
[The Scorcher produces a contract from a fire. Ice King yells until he realizes what it is.]
Ice King: Oh, yes, of course. [He signs the contract.] There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads:
Echos of past events
nudge the tiller on
my present course
I await its reflection
in the future.
Ice King looks at it and throws it away.]
Ice King: Oh, glad all that's over. [Ice King gets up on Finn and Jake's ice chambers.] Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt! [Ice King laughs.]
[Flame Princess slaps Finn, leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face.]
Flame Princess: Don't ever mess with me again!
[Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire.]
Finn: [Looks at Jake] Who was that?
Jake: [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
Finn: [Looks out the window, then back at Jake] Dude, I think I have a crush.
[Finn walks in front of Jake.]
Finn: What do you know about her, Jake?
Jake: I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!
Finn: You shut your dirty mouth! [Slaps Jake. Finn's angry outburst causes the burn mark to disappear]
Jake: Dirty? [Checks gums] Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil!
Finn: Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul. [Walks to the window] She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.
Jake: Hmmm..
Finn: C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out. [Rubs Jake's face] Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!
Jake: Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.
Finn: Whoo! Alright!
[The scene cut to Jake walking over trees as a giant with Finn on his head.]
Jake: You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.
[Light shines on Finn and Jake as a burning bird flies away.]
Finn: Is that bird... smoking?
Brown Bird: Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me.
[Jake stretches down the bushes as he and Finn hide behind them. They see Flame Princess touching flowers and burning them]
Flame Princess: Oh.
[The fire burns other flowers, spreading towards a lake.]
Flame Princess: [Gasps]
Finn: Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.
Jake: Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!
Finn: [Focusing on Flame Princess] Yeah, she is like a cute little flower.
[Flame Princess walks towards the lake, kneels and dips her hand in it]
Flame Princess: Aaahh!
Finn: [Comes out of the bush] Oh, no, are you ok?
Flame Princess: [Gasps]
Finn: I... I was just worried about you.
Flame Princess: Huh?
Finn: Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you, [Flame Princess glows brighter] but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.
[Flame Princess glows brightly]
Finn: [Sees fire beneath him] Whoa!
[Finn stomps on fire, but stops when he sees Flame Princess reacting with pain.]
Flame Princess: Ah!
[Finn stomps on fire again]
Flame Princess: Ow!
Finn: Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?
Flame Princess: Yes! That's all you've done! [gasps] Are you trying to hurt me?! Is that why you're following me?!
Finn: I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you.
Flame Princess: [Gasps then runs away]
Finn: Hey, no wait! [Chases Flame Princess]
Finn: [Laughs awkwardly] I guess now I'm technically chasing you. [Laughs again]
[Jake comes out of the bushes]
Jake: Finn!
[Flame Princess burns tree. Tree falls down, blocking Finn and Jake]
Jake: Hold on! [Turns into a giant and uses his "buns" to put out the fire on the tree]
Jake: Eaoww.. Toasty buns. [Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest]
Finn: Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!
[Flame Princess appears as trails of fire then reforms]
Finn: Whoa.
Flame Princess: I am ambushing you! [Throws fireball]
Finn and Jake: Aah!
[Finn and Jake run around to avoid fireballs]
Finn: Hey, I like your fireballs.
Flame Princess: Huh? Why do you torment me?
Finn: I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.
Flame Princess: I... [Smiles, blushes and glows brightly]
Finn: [Smiles, claps, and laughs in excitement] Yeah.
Flame Princess: Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.
Finn: Wait wait, I really didn't--
Flame Princess: You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt! [Throws a big fireball at Finn and Jake]
Flame Princess: You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!
Finn: No!
[Flame Princess creates a fire wall as Finn and Jake back away from the fire]
Jake: She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!
Finn: I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!
Jake: Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?
Finn: Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.
Jake: Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.
[Scene cuts to the Tree Fort's garage.]
Finn: [Frantically searching pile of junk] Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.
Jake: Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. [Sees a bag of bread] Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? [Slightly shoves the bag, showing Neptr.]
Neptr: Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me! [Spins his oven body] Hahahaha-hahaha.
Jake: [Whispers to Finn] Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.
Finn: Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...
Neptr: I missed you, creator.
Finn: And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--
Neptr: To count to 100 while you hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--
[Finn halts Neptr]
Finn: Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?
[Neptr raises his arm]
Neptr: You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.
[Neptr raps "Working for the Master" as he builds Finn and Jake fire-proof suits while the two assist him]
Neptr: I am finished!
[The scene cuts to Finn flying with his suit.]
Finn: I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.
Neptr: Haha, we are as one, creator.
Finn: Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?
[Jake rises up as Finn spins to avoid Jake]
Jake: DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens! [Whispers] And sock angels!
Finn: We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.
[Finn and Jake fly above trails of fire as they see the kingdom]
Finn: There she is.
[Flame Princess shoots fire on houses]
Finn: She seems okay.
Goblin: AAAAHH! Wood for sale! Wood on fire for sale!
[Flame Princess shoots out two lines of fire and turns around]
Flame Princess: It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.
Finn: Flame Princess!
[Flame Princess turns]
Finn: Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.
Flame Princess: I've heard this all before. [Shoots fireballs at Finn and Jake but their suits put out the fireballs. They land in front of Flame Princess]
Flame Princess: You... MEANIE! [Throws fireball at Finn. The suit deflects the fireball as the latter bounces. Hitting a goblin's cart.]
Goblin: My cart. I was born in that cart!
Jake: [Gasp] I'll put it out! [Jake runs through cart and crashes into a building.]
Flame Princess: Ah!
Finn: Aah! Jake didn't mean that!
[Flame Princess shoots a stream of fire at a building.]
Jake: Oh... [Hovers near the fire.] I need your help Finn! This one's too big! [Kicks fire]
Flame Princess: Ah! Whyyyy?!
Finn: No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!
Neptr: I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster. [Neptr raises the suits right arm and retracts the hand into a blaster.] Hold still, burning lady.
[Neptr turns the suit around and aims the blaster at Flame Princess]
Finn: Wha?
Neptr: Locked on target.
Finn: [Finn holds the blaster with his suit's left hand] No, Neptr!
Neptr: Yes, creator.
[Finn turns the suit around, before the blaster fires]
Finn: NOOOO!
[The blaster hits Flame Princess's fire]
Flame Princess: AH!
Finn: [Distressed] I'm sorry!
[Neptr lowers the right arm down, hitting Jake with foam as his suit is covered by it.]
Flame Princess: That is the last time you hurt me. [Transforms into her giant form] RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Finn: My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!
[Finn turns to look at Flame Princess]
Finn: [Gasp]
Neptr: Oh, my...
[Flame Princess turns around and burns the whole city.]
Finn: NO!
Flame Princess: RAAAAAAAAAHH! [A "tear" comes out from Flame Princess's right eye.]
Finn: No more... No more! [Kneels the suit then rips out of his suit and climbs at its top.] FLAME PRINCESS!
[Flame Princess walks away]
Finn: I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... I've failed everyone.
[Neptr turns]
Neptr: Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.
[Finn looks at Jake, who is moving his own suit's limbs. Jake takes a scoop of the foam and eats it.]
Jake: Mmm! [Smiles and gets another scoop.]
Finn: No. Why can't I just like a girl? [Finn's tear drops onto Flame Princess's fire.]
Flame Princess: Ow! [Looks angrily at Finn. She notices he's crying.] Huh?
[Dives as a fire towards Finn while she shrinks her size.]
Finn: [Coughs then faints.]
Flame Princess: [Touches Finn's tears then jumps back] Oh.
[Flame Princess puts all of her fire out.]
Finn: [Gasps for air then coughs; he sees Flame Princess by his side.] Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?
Flame Princess: I understand now. You're a water elemental.
Finn: What?
Flame Princess: You're my opposite. You create water.
Finn: What, cry? No, I j--
Flame Princess: Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.
Finn: N-No. I-I don't usually do that.
Flame Princess: That's your power.
Finn: No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! [waves his hands while blushing.]
Flame Princess: Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.
Finn: No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?
Flame Princess: You would defy nature for me?
Finn: Uh... yeah, whatevs.
[Finn and Flame Princess hug, Finn tries to bear the pain but pulls away.]
Finn: Aaah.. Uh.
Flame Princess: Bye, Finn. [Departs]
Neptr: Goodbye, lady.
Jake: FINN! [Stretches up.] Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!
Finn: WHAAAAT!?!
Jake: Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see?
[Jake gestures towards the crowd of unharmed goblins]
Jake: So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?
Finn: She hugged me... then left.
Jake: Whoa! How did it feel?
Finn: [Turns to the direction Flame Princess took while leaving a trail of fire behind.] It hurt.
[The episode begins showing a black tree. It turns to show its face.]
Finn: The Tree of Blight.
[The tree roars in the center of a dark forest; the camera pans out to show Finn and Jake.]
Finn: Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
Jake: Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. [The duo walks forward.] Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.
[The Alpha Hug Wolf suddenly lunges out and Finn and Jake gasp. She lands next to the duo and punches Finn rather softly.]
Alpha Hug Wolf: Huuugs!
Finn: What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! [Pushes her away.] Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
[Jake runs off.]
Alpha Hug Wolf: Huuuugs! [Finn grunts and they begin circling each other] Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!
Jake: Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!
Finn: No! [Gasps as the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf makes a roaring charge at him. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf embraces Finn and howls.] Jake, hurry!
Jake: Is he crushin' you, man?!
Finn: [Lowering his voice slightly] No, he's just... hugging me gently!
Jake: Oh...! [Turns and talks to tree] When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."
[Jake sets the tree on fire which makes it explode; a piece of the tree lands on the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf and she runs off screaming. Finn is violently coughing.]
Jake: Hey, buddy, you okay?
Finn: Didn't even tell me its name...
Jake: Wha..,?
Finn: [Noticing the tree is burned down] Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
Finn and Jake: [In unison] Hot to the touch!
[Scene cuts to Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. Jake is whistling and playing Portender Defender on BMO. He notices Finn is hugging BMO and stops playing.]
Jake: Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?
Finn: I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
Jake: Hmm... [Feels Finn's forehead] You've got a fever, man.
Finn: I feel hot. [Holds BMO tighter]
BMO: Finn, you're hurting me.
Jake: I think you need a good night's sleep.
[Scene transition to Finn and Jake's bedroom. Finn is seen hugging a pillow and Jake blows out a candle. Finn whines like a dog in his sleep. Cut to the next day; Finn and Jake are picking up litter in the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: You feelin' better today?
Finn: Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
Jake: Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? [Eats some of it] Litter for lunch! Mmm!
[Finn continues picking it up and Cinnamon Bun enters and runs into Finn.]
Cinnamon Bun: Huh? Not again!
Finn: What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
Cinnamon Bun: Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.
Finn: Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
Cinnamon Bun: Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! [Groans in pain]
[Jake joins in.]
Finn: CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. [Laughs; Cinnamon Bun also starts to laugh. Jake just makes a worried face. Cinnamon Bun exits as his laugh fades. Finn and Jake sit down.] Oh, Cinnamon Bun. [Eats some candy litter] [Muffled] What a crazy story, buddy.
Jake: Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.
Finn: Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
Jake: I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.
Finn: [Eats more litter] [Muffled] But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
Jake: No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.
[Scene cuts to a library.]
Jake: Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?
Finn: ...So...?
[Jake pulls out a book and drops it on the ground. Jake opens it.]
Jake: Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. [Reading book] "Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!
Finn: Like last night!
Jake: Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.
Finn: Well, how can I get uncursed?
Jake: Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.
Finn: Uh... I'm scared, Jake... [Attempts to hug Jake but he slaps him away]
Jake: No hugs!!
Finn: I'm sorry! [Grunts] I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
[Jake looks worried. Cut back to the Tree Fort where Jake is covering Finn with bags of frozen peas. BMO is whimpering.]
Jake: What's wrong, BMO?
BMO: I am terrified of Finn.
Jake: Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. [BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief] You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn: I think so.
Jake: I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn: Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
Jake: I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.
Finn: Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
Jake: Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?
Finn: Prickly and painful.
Jake: Good, good, you're doin' great!
Finn: Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
Jake: No, you can't hug anything.
Finn: But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! [Stands up and knocks bags of peas off body, knocking Jake down. He pants heavily then growls.]
Jake: Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!
Finn: [Growling fiercely] I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
[Jake ties Finn up with rope then chains him down.]
Jake: Finn... say something to reassure me.
Finn: I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
[Jake makes a frightened noise and backs away quickly.]
BMO: Jake! We need the silver baseball!
[The full moon outside is shown and shines from behind the clouds. Finn completes his transformation.]
Finn: Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! [Howls]
BMO: Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!
Finn: Bring it in, guys!
BMO: Screamoooo!
Jake: BMO! Strobe light mode! [BMO activates his strobe lights.]
Finn: Not cool!
Jake: Back, beast!
Finn: Hug wolf, away!
[Finn busts out of a window howling and runs to the Candy Kingdom. The scene cuts there.]
Mr. Cupcake: Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers. [Finn pants heavily and his POV is viewed as he watches Mr. Cupcake and goes towards him.] Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!
Finn: [Hugs him] Hug you up, bro! [Grunts and roars as Mr. Cupcake groans]
[Finn jumps to the Gumdrop teenager's balcony and enters her room and creeps towards her in bed]
Gumdrop teenager: Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!!
Finn: [Roaring] HUUUUGS!!
[The Gumdrop Dad bursts in holding a Candy cane shotgun.]
Gumdrop dad: Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager! [Mimicking the sound a shotgun makes when one cocks it] Ch-ch... [Mimics a gunshot noise and shoots the teenager's mirror.]
Gumdrop teenager: Aaah!!
Gumdrop dad: Ch-ch. [Fake gunshot noise; repeats a couple of times as Finn runs away] Ch-ch. [Goes towards window] Eh... eh... SHE'LL NEVER MARRY! [Chases Finn away with more gunfire]
[Transition to the next day; Jake is walking with BMO in the Candy Kingdom.]
Jake: Finn? Finn?
BMO: There he is!
[Finn is in a river. Jake shakes him awake.]
Finn: Huh? Huh? [Princess Bubblegum chases a cat in the background] What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
Jake: You hugged... everyone.
Finn: NO!
[Candy People appear and shout angrily]
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone: We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.
Finn: People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
[Scene cuts to the Candy Dungeon.]
Candy Baby: Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?
Candy Mother: Oh, baby... [Hugs him in concern]
Jake: Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!
Candy Person #29: Yeah!
Candy Person #33: Yeah, I agree with the last guy!
Jake: Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!
Cinnamon Bun: Uuuuuhhhh...
Jake: Let's go, boys!!
Cinnamon Bun: Uh... bu-, bububut...
Crowd: No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs!
Random Candy Person: Without consent!!
Cinnamon Bun: Uh...
Finn: Huh? [Watches full moon appear from behind clouds and gasps] HUUUGS!! [Growls]
Cinnamon Bun: Finn? [Finn keeps growling as he transforms.] Uh...
Finn [Fully transformed]: Cinnamon Bun... let me out...
Cinnamon Bun: I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.
Finn: Don't you want a hug?
Cinnamon Bun: I can't, man!
Finn: Not even a little one?
Cinnamon Bun: Uuuuhhh...
Finn: You want a hug?
Cinnamon Bun: [Mutters] YES!! HUG ME!!!! [To himself] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... [Unlocking door] Which way does this turn?!? [Finn lunges out with a roar and tackles Cinnamon Bun.] Owww! Ow, my sides.
[Scene cuts to the forest from the beginning of the episode.]
Candy crowd: SAY NO TO HUGS!
Jake: I smell someone bein' hugged right now! [Spots ‎Alpha Hug Wolf hugging an antelope.]
Antelope: Uh... I have a wife.
Jake: That hug be your last, demon!
[Jake stretches his arms and repeatedly punches the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf]
Alpha Hug Wolf: Rrr...still love you! [Attempts to embrace Jake's arms but misses] Raaah! Come here, baby!
Jake: No huggies! [‎Alpha Hug Wolf lands in front of Jake and the crowd. The crowd mutters, frightened.] Eh... Finn... I've failed you.
[Suddenly, Finn lunges out in the same way the Alpha Hug Wolf did at the beginning of the episode and tackles her. They commence their "hug battle."]
Alpha Hug Wolf: I'm gonna hug you up.
Finn: You call that a hug?
[They continue their battle.]
Jake: This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!
[Finn and the wolf begin sparking as they battle. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf forces Finn near a cliff, but Finn gets a hold of her before she can push him off. They both start glowing; they howl as soon an explosion occurs and forms a heart-shaped cloud that blows several mountain goats away. The smoke clears.]
Finn [Back to normal]: Uuuugghhh... Huh? [Finn notices that the ‎Beautiful Lady is also back to normal; she lets out tired groans] You... You stopped hugging me.
Beautiful Lady: Yeah... You stopped, too.
Finn: I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.
Beautiful Lady: Me neither.
Candy Person #29: The curse is broken!
Jake: [Runs up to her] Can I get a hug?
Finn: [disgusted] JAKE!!!!!
[Suddenly, the girl turns into another screeching Tree of Blight]
Jake: AAAH—!
[The episode begins in the Ice Kingdom.]
Ice King: [Off-screen] Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?!
Gunter: Wenk! [Sips drink]
Ice King: One, two, three... [He comes out, revealing he's wearing a Marceline wig.] [Singing] Gunter! [Sings the Gunter version of the Fry song] [Gunter stares lovingly at Ice King.] [Speaking] It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me! [The penguin pulls off Ice King's wig.] Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah! [The Ice King notices that the penguin is chewing on the wig.] Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.
[Walks to a bookshelf and pulls out a book]
Ice King: Jay T. Doggzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re... [Unsure] Hmm. [Flies up and grabs the penguin] Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room!
[Carrying the penguin, he flies down to the depths of his lair and arrives in a room full of various items.] Ah, yes. [He opens a drawer and takes out his scrapbook.]
Ice King: Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here. [Sniffs it] Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration. [Throws scrapbook on pile of junk] So where's Marceline living these days?
Penguin: Wenk.
Ice King: A cave?? [Blows a small raspberry]
[Ice King flies out of his lair, carrying the penguin, an Omnichord, and a drumset. He's being viewed through binoculars.]
Finn: [Viewing Ice King] Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.
Jake: Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.
Finn: Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?
Jake: Dinner roll!
[Scene transition to Marceline's cave. Marceline is strumming her ax bass. She notices Ice King coming in the cave through her window.]
Ice King: Hello? Anybody home?
Marceline: [To herself] No... [She goes outside her house.] What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!
Ice King: [Laughs] Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.
Marceline: I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!
Ice King: [Desperate] Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does! [Beat; Marceline is scowling.] Ee-yoop!
[He laughs as he flies into her house. Marceline waves Gunter goodbye and follows Ice King. Gunter looks down in disappointment and walks away.]
Marceline: [Landing on porch; to Ice King] Hey!!
Ice King: Eh...
Marceline: Get outta here!!
Ice King: Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far! [He unties his equipment and it falls to the ground.] [To himself] Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard... [He grunts as he tries to untangle it. Marceline just stares.] Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no. [He lays on the ground, trapped in the tangled cord.] Ice King's in trouble. [She looks at him awkwardly.] [Grunts] [To Marceline] Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya. [Hums a tune] Is that good?
[The door opens.]
Finn & Jake: Ice King!
Finn: ...Wha?
Jake: Oh... You got 'im.
Finn: Nice job, Marceline.
[Jake walks up to Ice King.]
Jake: [Talking like Batman] Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.
[Jake picks up Ice King. He and Finn start to walk off with him.]
Marceline: No, he can stay.
Finn & Jake: Wha?!
Ice King: Yeah, "Wha?!"
Marceline: It's alright. We're working on a song together. [She takes Ice King.]
Finn: You don't want us to... [Connects palm with fist] ...for you?
Marceline: No, it's okay. You guys can go.
[Finn and Jake begin to exit, confused.]
Finn: ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...
[They look around awkwardly.]
Finn & Jake: Bye... [They exit.]
Ice King: [To Marceline] You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy!
[She immediately drops him.]
[Scene transition. Marceline plugs in and turns on the Omnichord.]
Marceline: So what kinda song're we playing?
Ice King: Ooh. I brought these [the scrapbook pages] for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.
[She grabs a page. It's drenched in tears.]
Marceline: Oookaaaay...
[She plays the Omnichord.]
Ice King: Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that! [Ice King snaps to the music.] [Singing] Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum! [Marceline looks uncomfortable.] I really need someone. [She sadly looks down.] Or anyone! [Saddening] ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone! [Activating ice magic] Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?! [Shooting frozen lightning bolts] Anybody! [Tearing up] Anybody! [Marceline turns at the sound of his distress.] [Speaking] Anybody!!! [Practically sobbing] Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!
Marceline: Stop acting like this!!
Ice King: No, it's just startin' to get good!! [Shooting ice beams everywhere, singing] Anybody!! [Speaking] Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!! [Crying] Love me!!
[She forces him to the ground.]
Marceline: [Direct] STOP ACTING CRAZY.
Ice King: I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!! [Pushes her off forcefully] Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you. [He goes to the kitchen and plants his head against the refrigerator in sadness.] Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way. [Climbs on refrigerator] Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.
[Marceline walks to the refrigerator and sighs. She then opens it and takes out an apple. Ice King's beard lightly rubs her head.]
Marceline: Huh?
Ice King: Whatcha got? An apple?
Marceline: [Frustrated] Ugh! [She drops the apple and just drops down, sitting in front of the fridge. She rolls the apple away; the apple reaches the Omnichord and turns it on.] [Singing] You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts. [Beat] Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you! [Speaking] Maybe I'm the one who's... [Sighing] nuts.
[The Omnichord switches off.]
Ice King: Hold on! [Drops from fridge] Do you... like me?!
Marceline: ...Of course I do, you old jerk!
Ice King: Really? ...Wow. [Wipes dirt off sleeve] How about... [Spreading arms out] one of these? [Marceline's scowl fades. She consents and hugs him, visibly bittersweet about it.] Ah! [They pull back and look at each other in the eyes. He puckers his lips.] Mwah, mwah, mwah...
Marceline: [Disgusted] AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON?
Ice King: What-mon?
Marceline: Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are!
Ice King: Yes, I do! I am a lyricist! [Pulling pages out] It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! [Laughs]
[Marceline stares, devastated. A photo lands in her hands.]
Marceline: Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!
[The picture portrays a human Ice King walking out of a car ready to deliver the Enchiridion to a museum.]
Ice King: Huh? [He can't make heads or tails of it.] Heh?
[Marceline hurries to look for something else. She finds a picture of herself as a child and gasps.]
Marceline: This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? [She reads the back of the photo, visibly in great shock.]
Ice King: Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics? [Grabbing Omnichord] I'll get the keyboard!
Marceline: What? [In desperation] Wait, listen!
Ice King: [Sets Omnichord up] Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!
[Marceline reads the message again, then stares at Ice King, not sure what to do.]
Marceline: [Singing and reading note] "Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."
Ice King: Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! [Goes to drumset]
Marceline: [Looking for another photo] Oh! Um... [Singing and reading note] "This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me [Pulling hair back, stressed out] crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do [Marceline shrinks in devastation] ...when I don't remember you."
Ice King: [Happy] Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!
Marceline: What?! You don't remember what it means?! [She grabs another photo and shows it to him. She tears up as her voice breaks.] Look!
Ice King: [Reads note while singing] "Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown. [He frowns and looks confused, but then ignores it.] This magic keeps me—"
Ice King & Marceline: [Singing together] "—alive, but it's making me crazy, [Marceline begins shedding tears.] and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."
[Finn and Jake are still in the cave. Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars.]
Jake: What is goin' on in there?!
Finn: [Takes binoculars off] ...I have no idea.
Ice King & Marceline: [Singing together] "...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you."
[As the music continues [and Ice King and Marceline sing, "Da da... da da... da da..."], the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse. It looks dismal and there are ruined buildings everywhere. A child Marceline cries. Simon Petrikov returns to her and wipes her tears in recompense for leaving her alone. He walks to a ruined store and grabs a teddy bear. He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further amends, and she smiles sweetly. The episode ends.]
[The episode starts when Finn and Jake were helping Flame Princess's target practice.]
Jake: Ready?
Flame Princess: Yes
Jake: [Sounds of concentration] [Then farts] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.]
Flame Princess: [Shoots the balloon with her fire] [Balloon explodes]
Finn: That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn. [Lies on Jake's back] [Sounds of concentration] [Then burps] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.]
Flame Princess: [Focuses on balloon and shoots the balloon] [Balloon explodes]
Finn: [Laughter]
Flame Princess: [Laughter] You guys are full of magic air.
Jake: [Gasps] [Farts]
Finn: [Disgusted] Gross! [Rolls with Jake] [Then slaps Jake] No! [Turns to Flame Princess] Princess? You, okay?
Flame Princess: [Looks downed] Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. [Looks at Finn and Jake] I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.
Jake: Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.
Flame Princess: [Sighs] [Then stands up] Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR! [Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.] [Screams with anger]
Finn & Jake: [Frightened]
Finn: Uh, we can go get 'em.
Flame Princess: [Returns to her normal form.] [Pleasant voice] Really? That would be really nice. [Warns] But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.
Flambo: [Farts]
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake: [Surprised]
Jake: That ain't me.
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake: [Looks at the rock]
Finn & Jake: Whoa!
Flambo: [inside the rock] [Farts more]
Finn & Jake: [Approaches the rock]
Finn: [Opens the rock]
Flambo: Oh! [Farts again]
Finn: [Relieved]
Jake: Flambo! [Whispers to Finn] For a second, I thought the princess was farting.
Finn: Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.
Flambo: [Agrees to Finn] Alright! [Rubs both of his hands] [Flambo casting the Flame Shield; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols. He grows two big fists and hits Finn and Jake on the forehead.]
[Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom]
Jake: [Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back, sneaking pass the Flame Guards.]
[Seconds later, inside Flame Princess's room in the palace]
Finn & Jake: [Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles.]
Finn: These candles, must be "They."
Jake: [Sniffing the candles] [Whispers] They smell like an old lady's bathroom.
Finn: [Whispers with anger] Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!
Jake: [Whispers in reply] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.
Finn: [Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack.]
[Seconds later, two voices are heard behind the door.]
Furnius: No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess [Finn jumps and lies close to the bottom of the door.] leaved [for left] the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?
Finn: [Gasps] [Then whispers] A conspirator with a hiss voice!
Torcho: How about, water?
Furnius: Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.
Finn: [Whispers] And a conspirator with an untied shoe.
Torcho: Ice? Why ice?
Furnius: Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King.
Furnius & Torcho: [Evil laughter]
Finn: [Gasps, turns around, and Jake is thrown away.]
Jake: Whoa!
Finn: Did you hear that?
Jake: [Sniffs]
Finn: Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!
Jake: [Drops the candle] Right, right.
[Moments later, outside the room]
Jake: [Opens the door]
Finn: Dirt bags! Where'd they go?
Finn & Jake: [Tip toe walking]
Jake: [Gasps]
[Lesser Flame Guards approaching nearby]
Finn & Jake: [Plans via body language] [Then disguises themselves as a painting]
Lesser Flame Guards: [Walking backwards]
Lesser Flame Guard 1: [Notices] Hey, is that new?
Lesser Flame Guard 2: Yeah, I think it is.
Lesser Flame Guard 3: Yes it is new.
Lesser Flame Guard 2: Hm, what you guys think about this painting?
Lesser Flame Guard 1: I like it.
Lesser Flame Guard 3: Hey, is this one of those paintings where the eyes follow you.
Lesser Flame Guards: [Looks at the painting]
Finn: [Concentrating]
Lesser Flame Guards: [Moves to the right and left while looking at them.]
Finn: [Still concentrating]
Lesser Flame Guard 1: Hmmm
Lesser Flame Guard 2: [Sighs]
Lesser Flame Guards: [Moves to the right] [Gets bored]
Lesser Flame Guard 3: Come on, let's get out of here, I don't wanna miss snack time.
Lesser Flame Guard 1: SNACKS!
Lesser Flame Guard 2: And SNACKS!
Lesser Flame Guard 3: SNACKS!
Lesser Flame Guards: SNACKS! [Walking backwards] SNACKS! SNACKS! SNACKS!
Finn: [Losing concentrating]
Finn & Jake: [Breaths]
Jake: Now what?
Furnius: And most of actual murdersss...
Finn: [Whispers] You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss.
Jake: The kind we are looking for.
Furnius: The ssserpent that isss...
Finn: Stop!
Furnius: ...my father's life, now wears his crown. [Hisses]
Finn & Jake: [Looks above]
Jake: Dude, the voice
Finn: We must follow the voice
Jake: [Opens the air vent] [Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.] [Then closes the air vent]
Unknown: To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream...
Finn: [Whispers] Which way is the hiss voice coming from?
Unknown: ...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what...
Jake: [Whispers] This way!
Unknown: ...dreams may come.
Jake: [Drags self]
Finn: [Whispers] Which way?
Furnius: I seem to be saying a lot about our [Jake raises his left ear] super secret plan
Jake: [Whispers] To the left
Fire Denizens 1: You!
Jake: [Checking out]
Fire Denizens 1: [Pointing with their right finger at each other] You! You! You!
Fire Denizens 2: [Pointing with both fingers at each other] Double you! Double you!
Jake: [Whispers] I don't think it's them.
Fire Denizens 2: Double you! Double you!
[Finn and Jake moving forward and turning left]
Jake: [Falls] Whooaaa.
Finn: [Whispers for checking] Jake!
Jake: [Whispers in response] I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way!
Finn: [Falls down toward Jake] Whooooo! [Falls flat on his face.] [Questions with disappointment] Why didn't you catch me?
Jake: Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future.
[Moments later]
Jake: [Whispers] Vent ahead.[And looks outside]
Finn: [Whispers] Jake, I wanna see. [Jake steps aside]
Lesser Flame Guard 3: [Eating cake] [Then measures cake] Thirty-seven... [Eats another and measures again] Twenty-two
Finn: [Whispers] No hissing.
Jake: [Whispers] No untied shoe.
[Moments later, Jake found another vent]
Jake: [whispers] Vent
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: This need something more, yes...
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: ...yes, that's the...
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: ...stuff.
Finn: [Whispers] Whoa, it's him!
[The air vent is opened]
Finn & Jake: [Dives quietly]
Jalapeño pepper: Hmmm?
Finn & Jake: [Shows up]
Jalapeño pepper: My blueb'ies!
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jake: [Points right finger to Jalapeño pepper] You baffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe?
Jalapeño pepper: What partner? What are you blueberries...?
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: ...talking about?
Finn: [Rises fist) Give it up man! [Then points right finger to Jalapeño pepper] I heard your hiss voice!
Jalapeño pepper: I don't have a hiss...
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: ...voice. [Then points right finger to Finn] There's a....
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jalapeño pepper: ....snake on your shoulder.
Finn: What?
Red snake: [Hisses]
Finn: [Frightened] [Slaps the snake away from him and landed on Jake.]
Jake: [Looks at the snake] Hmmmm.
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jake: Sufferin'...
Red snake: [Hisses]
Jake: ...succotash.
Jalapeño pepper: Now to chop you two big blueberries into small bite-sized blueberries. [Then chases after them]
Finn & Jake: [Screaming and running for their lives]
[Monents later]
Theater troupe: [Chattering]
Theater troupe leader: Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes.
Finn & Jake: [Takes two members of the theater troupe to a room.]
Finn: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Jake: [Picks up a table with food on it]
Finn & Jake: [Runs with disguises on]
Jalapeño pepper: [Panting] [Then heads to a room] Oh. Psh, actors.
[Moments later, Finn and Jake catch up with the theater troupe]
Finn: [Lays a hand on a theater troupe member] What's going with the costumes?
Theater troupe member: [High voice] This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. [Lowered voice] Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. [Turns around and picks clothes]
Jake: [Makes a distance with Finn] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.
Finn: [Likes it] That's brilliant!
Jake: Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.
[Moments later, at the stage play, Flame King appears and the lights went low for the play.]
Audience: [Cheering]
Finn: [Clears throat] Hey conspirator!
Jake: Hey co-conspirator!
Finn: Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
Jake: Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.
Flame King: [Not liking it] Man, I am so lost.
Jake: Psst, the audience.
Suspect: [Moaning] [Then sneezes]
Jake: You think that's one of them.
Finn: Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
Jake: Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.
Suspect: [Still moaning] [Then eats a hot dog] [Looking around with suspicion]
Finn: I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
Flame King: [Bored] Psh, kill the Flame King? [Thinks about it] [Then behind him, an arm appeared, holding ice and fails to pour on him.] [Angry reaction] This is treason disguised as a play! [Orders] Guards, seized them!
Flame Guards: [Approaching Finn and Jake]
Finn: What!? No!
Flame Guards: [Pinning Finn and Jake to the ground]
Finn & Jake: [Grunts]
Finn: Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!
Flame King: Hmmmmm, search them!
Flame Guard: Hmmmm, [Surprised] Huh? [Sniffs the candles] Sire! It's your daughter's scented candles.
Finn: Ahh... ahh, ah.
Flame King: Sickos! [Orders] Off with their heads!
Jake: Whoa, what!?
Audience: [Cheering and chattering] Yes!
Furnius: Sssstay sssstill.
Finn: Sssstill?
Torcho: [Evil laughter]
Finn: Untied shoelace? [Gasps] It's them!
Furnius: Sssso long, ssssuckers!
Finn: NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
Flame King: [Surprised]
Finn: NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
Audience: [Gasps and shocked]
Finn: NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! [Clears throat] We found 'em! The executioners are the real king killers!
Audience: [Disbelief]
Furnius: Ssssilence!
Flame King: Wa-wa-wait, wait. That voice. [Orders] Guards, take off their hoods.
Torcho: Here, my identity!
Furnius: [Hisses]
Torcho: [Guilty] Argh
Flame King: [Surprised] Furnius and Torcho!
Furnius: Hello Uuuncle!
Audience: [Shocked and surprised] Wait, what!?
Flame King: [Orders] Arrest the executioners!
Flame Guards: [Arrests the executioners]
Flame King: Hmmmm, [Points right finger at Furnius and Torcho] I thought I had you two extinguished.
Furnius: You cannot quench the flamessss of revenge!
Torcho: You snucked on our father to become king!
Flame King: Oh, yeah! Hehe. [Orders] Take them to the punishment room!
Flame Guards: [Takes Furnius and Torcho to the punishment room.]
Furnius: I'll dessstroy all of you, with ice!
Torcho: Release me!
Finn: Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?
Flame King: [Yes tone]
Finn: And everyone is evil here?
Flame King: [Performs a stunt towards the stage]
Flame King: [Yes tone] All evil.
Finn: Then, is Flame Princess: evil or maybe chaotic neutral?
Flame King: She's evil.
Finn: Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?
Flame King: Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.
Finn: [Smiles happily]
Finn & Jake: [Leaves the stage]
Flame King: [Thinks about his daughter] Change her to good? [Worried]
[Scene cuts to Flame Princess's house]
[Through window, Finn and Jake look at Flame Princess sleeping.]
Finn: Aww...
Flame Princess: [Breathing]
Jake: [Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess's hair] [Then puts them on her bedside table]
[Then suddenly, Flame King appears on the candles.]
Flame King: [Looks around] Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!
Flame Princess: [Wakes up] Aah!
Flame King: Aah!
Flame Princess: [Turns around right after what she saw]
[At the top of the Tree Fort, Finn watching, Jake eating a watermelon and Princess Bubblegum showing her latest invention.]
Princess Bubblegum: And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics.
[Fireworks burst, splashing Finn with multi-colored liquid.]
Jake: That's really cool, PB!
Princess Bubblegum: Aw, thanks, puppy. [Draws Jake onto her lap.]
Jake: Isn't it cool, Finn?
[Princess Bubblegum looks at Finn]
Finn: [Stammering] Owwww-guh...
Princess Bubblegum: [Giggles]
[Finn makes an attempt to put his head on her lap, but she pushes him away]
Princess Bubblegum: Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later.
[The pyrotechnics bring rain clouds and thunder as Princess Bubblegum leaves]
[Finn becomes heart-broken as rain begins to fall]
Finn: Huh? Oh. [Finn and Jake run inside the Tree Fort away from the rain]
[Later, inside the house]
Jake: It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.
Finn: [Sighing]
Jake: [Whispers] BMO, put on a game.
[BMO turns on a game and Finn begins to sing a song seemingly to its tune: "All Gummed Up Inside"]
Finn: [Sighs dejectedly]
Jake: Oh, Finn.... Uncle Jakey's gonna find you a new love interest.
[Jake walks out and wears a pair of boots and a backpack.]
Jake: Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.
Finn: [Makes a pained noise]
Jake: BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes.
BMO: If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.
Jake: Ok, good.
[Jake goes down the ladder, then leaves the Tree Fort.]
[Jake sings the "Lady Song" while walking above the trees.]
Flambo: [Screams]
Jake: Woman!
[Flambo is covering under the wash tub and is under attack by Iron Owls.]
Jake: I'll save you, wash tub princess!
Flambo: [Still screaming]
[Jake kicks the Iron Owls and saves Flambo.]
Jake: You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?!
Flambo: Yeah, it's me. [chuckles] Bet you thought I was dame on account of my girlish screamin'.
Jake: I did think that. [Throws the wash tub]
Flambo: Haha, well. Thanks, anyway, brother.
Jake: Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age?
Flambo: Oh, yeah. I know just the skirt, ...and she's way hot!
[Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom]
[Lava Man walking]
Jake: She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there.
Flambo: Heh, oh yeah.
[Flambo casting the Flame Shield; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols. He spits on Jake once the spell is cast, but that was apparently just to spit on him.]
Jake: Ow...
Flambo: There, I cast Flame Shield on yous. Also I spat on yous.
Jake: [Angered grunt] BMO-cam on.
Finn [on BMO's camera]: Gold-darn you, tear ducts! Yah! Yah! [punches himself in the eyes.]
Jake: Ugh... Hang in there, buddy.
[After a pack fire wolves pass by the two Fire Guards, the door opens and Jake and Flambo enter the castle.]
Jake: [Gasps]
[Flame Princess looks at the two visitors. The camera zooms out quickly to show the entire throne room.]
Jake: [Jake scratches his stomach] Yo! What up? I'm Jake, Jake the [Flambo hits Jake in the gut] Dooug.
Flambo: [Whispers] Dude, you gotta pretend like you're of royal blood.
Jake: Could have told me this sooner.
Flambo: Haha! Yeah.
[Jake and Flambo walks closer to the Flame King.]
Jake: Good morrow, Majesty! [Exclaims] I am Sir Jake, Baron of the Grasslands!
Flame King: Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak! [Points left hand at Jake.]
Jake: [Terrified] Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn.
Flame King: A prince?!
Flame People: [Chattering] A prince! Finn is a prince! Yeah, a prince!
Jake: Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter. [Points left hand at Flame Princess.]
Flame Princess: Oooh...
Flame King: Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince!
Jake: Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME!
Flame People: [Chattering] An awesome prince?! That's the best kind!
Flame King: Silence, my molten mommas. [Walks closer to Jake] We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries.
Flame People: [Chattering] Yeah, a gift! Where is the gift?!
Flambo: [Whispers] You're blowin' it, bromite.
Jake: [Smiles] A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts! [Shows to hands how many gifts he brought and claps.]
Flambo: [Surprised] What?!
Flame King: Hmmmm.... Three is more than one.
Flame People: [Chattering] Wait a second, three's a lot of gifts! I want three gifts!
Flame Princess: [Interested] Oooh...
Jake: The first gift is [looks inside the backpack] um-um-um this water bottle.
[Shakes the bottle and accidentally slips from the hand, consequently hitting the Flame Jester] Whoap!
Flame Jester: [Dances like an idiot.] [Groans]
Flame Princess: [Gasps and scowls]
Flame King: Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?! ("Why?!") ...I do hate my jester.
Jake: Uh, Prince Finn hated him too.
Flame Princess: Hmmm...
Jake: For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh!
[Sees a Fire Musician playing a Fire Guitar] A serenade, [Takes the Fire Guitar] that Finn wrote for m'lady.
[Jake plays the Fire Guitar and begins to sing a song: "All Warmed Up Inside"]
Flame Princess: [Applauds and sighs with admiration]
Flame King: A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way!
Jake: [Jake then checks on Finn with BMO's camera.] Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!
Finn: [Lets out crying huffs] BMO, go away! [Turns around]
BMO: [BMO performs a Kancho prank on Finn.] Whoooop.... Duck, Duck, Duck, Goose!
Finn [on BMO's camera]: [Yelps]
Flame King: Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed!
Jake: No, wait! Uh-um, [Exclaims] Prince Finn is here! [Stretches his stomach to look like Finn.] He's riiight... here!
Jake [Fake Finn]: Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world.
Flame King: A koala bear?
Jake [Fake Finn]: Uh, yes!
Jake: [Sounds of concentration]
[Then appeared a koala bear inside a box made from Jake's stretchy powers.]
Jake [Koala]: Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus!
Flame King: I don't like koalas anymore. Begone!
[Flame King shifts out of his armor as a flame and goes up.]
Jake [Fake Finn]: [Begins to cry]
Jake: Dude, don't cry.
Jake [Fake Finn]: Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum!
Jake: She's too old for you.
Jake [Fake Finn]: [Grabs Jake with both hands on both of Jake's shoulders] I don't care!
Jake: Come on! Flame Princess seems into you.
Jake [Fake Finn]: No, no, no! Only Bubblegum!
[Jake rubs Fake Finn to cheer him up, then Fake Finn bites Jake's left arm.]
Jake: Ouw, Finn! [Fake Finn strangles Jake] Finn, Finn, Finn, Finn stop man....
Jake [Fake Finn]: Ahh-ahh!
Jake: [Choking] Fiiiinn. [Then plays dead and inhales]
Flame King: Excellent!
Jake [Fake Finn]: Huh?!
Flame King: You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend...
Jake: [Whispers] Yeah!
Flame King: ... for my evil daughter!
Jake: Whaaaat?!
Flame King: She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations!
[Flame King pulls the lever releasing Flame Princess and his body evaporates and his armor starts to float up returning immediately to his throne.]
[The lamp opens and Flame Princess quickly gets out.]
Flame Princess: I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince. [Flame Princess embraces Fake Finn.]
Flame People: [Chattering] That's sweet. That's so sweet.
Jake: [Whispers] She seems normal.
Flame People: [Chattering] Yeah, she seems normal.
Flame Princess: Stop whispering! [Flame Princess transforms to her enraged form and turns the other citizens of the Fire Kingdom into flambits.]
Flambo: Hey, so that's where I came from.
[Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form.]
Jake [Fake Finn]: You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types.
Flame Princess: We're... what?
Jake [Fake Finn]: I changed my mind. I don't like you.
Flame Princess: You... WHAT?! [Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form.]
Jake [Fake Finn]: [Terrified] Uh, nothing. [Jake uses Fake Finn to pick himself up] Bye, Flambo. [Runs for his life]
[Fire Castle erupts]
[Later, Jake runs above ground and is near the Tree Fort.]
Jake: [Panting]
[Flame Princess is gaining on Jake]
[Jake pushes the door and quickly closes it behind him.]
Jake: Finn! I really messed up.
[Tree Fort shakes and the fire starts spreading.]
Jake: Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.
[Fire closing in and Jake and BMO start running.]
Jake: [Screaming]
[The flames start burning the two pictures of Princess Bubblegum.]
Finn: Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
[Tree Fort shakes again and Flame Princess appears climbing the Tree Fort outside the window.]
Finn: [Kicks the window, shattering it] Yaaah! [Finn goes out of the window]
[Flame Princess reaches the top of the Tree Fort and Princess Bubblegum's liquid fireworks are near to her flames.]
Finn: [To himself] Bubblegum's rockets! [Yelling at Flame Princess] Don't you touch her stuff!!!
[Flame Princess accidentally ignites the rest of Princess Bubblegum's liquid fireworks and the drops from the fireworks hit Flame Princess, dousing out her flames.]
Flame Princess: [Screams of pain]
[Flame Princess is reduced to her normal humanoid form, which surprises Finn.]
Finn: It's a girl.
[Flame Princess is still weakening, briefly passes out and begins to fall. Finn puts Princess Bubblegum's lock of hair on the side of the Tree Fort near the window he broke and catches Flame Princess in his arms.]
[Finn then goes inside the Tree Fort]
Flame Princess: You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!
Finn: [Contrary tone] I like you!
[Flame Princess blushes for a few moments]
Flame Princess: What's wrong with you?!
[Flame Princess slaps Finn, leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face]
Flame Princess: Don't ever mess with me again!
[Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire]
Finn: [Looks at Jake] Who was that?
Jake: [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
Finn: [Looks out the window, then back at Jake] Dude, I think I have a crush.
[The episode begins in Marceline's cave just outside of Marceline's house. Finn is beat-boxing and Marceline is strumming her ax bass guitar.]
Marceline: Thanks for helping me record, Finn.
Finn: No problem, Marceline.
Marceline: Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.
Finn: I would never dream of it... m'lady. [Laughs]
[Scene shifts to the inside of Marceline's house.]
Marceline: Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.
Finn: You got it!
[Finn starts beat-boxing and Marceline begins singing the Fry Song. Eventually, Finn's beat-boxing slows down and he sighs.]
Marceline: Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!
Finn: Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
Marceline: [Strums guitar] He's not worth the effort.
Finn: Not worth what effort?
Marceline: Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.
Finn: [Finn finishes drawing the face] Oh, yeah?! [Goes to grab some bug milk, then returns to throw it on the face; the bug milk gets absorbed by the face.]
[Note: Marceline is not paying attention to Finn's actions.]
Marceline: [Sighs] And then you're supposed to chant something like [The happy face glows and the candles next to it light up], "Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum." [Finn laughs and the face changes color.] But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries. [Marceline notices a strange noise and finally looks at Finn.] Huh?!
Finn: Wwwwhhhat?! [The room changes color drastically; a portal to the Nightosphere opens where the face was.] Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
[Marceline's father emerges.]
Lord of Evil: Marceline!
Marceline: Finn... what the heck did you do?!
Finn: I... reunited you with your family?
[Marceline grunts angrily and Finn backs away.]
Lord of Evil: Is this kid your evil servant?
Finn: I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
Lord of Evil: "Super good?" [Roars]
Finn: [Gasps; Lord of Evil grabs Finn, and begins sucking energy from him.] What're you doing?!
Lord of Evil: Stealing your soul.
[He continues and Finn screams in fright.]
Marceline: Dad! [Separates the two] Ugh! You always do stuff like this!
Lord of Evil: Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax?
Marceline: Wha—? HEY!!!
Lord of Evil: Did you turn it into some kind of lute?
Marceline: [Yelling in anger] Give it back, and get out!!!
Lord of Evil: Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...
Finn: [Stammering] WHA—Gh—NO!!
Lord of Evil: See you kids later! [Opens door]
[Lord of Evil laughs maniacally as Finn screams, terrified. Marceline's father shuts the door.]
Marceline: My bass!
Finn: I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
Marceline: Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.
[Scene shifts to Finn and Marceline flying above a forest.]
Finn: Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
Marceline: Finn! You can't kill my dad!
Finn: Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—
Marceline: No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!
Finn: Oh...
[Scene cuts to a field elsewhere; a bunch of Fluffy People are running around and laughing.]
Fluffy Person: [The Lord of Evil's shadow falls upon him and he stops running.] Huh? [Camera zooms out to show the Lord of Evil.] Who the fluff are you?
Lord of Evil: Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.
Fluffy Person: Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.
Lord of Evil: Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??
Fluffy Person: Wow...
Lord of Evil: First... close your eyes.
Fluffy Person: Okay! [Gets pounded by the ax bass.] AAH! You coulda killed me!
Lord of Evil: Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?
Fluffy Person: Yeah, I guess... So what?
Lord of Evil: So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. [Laughs maniacally as his transformed face moves towards the screen, sucking the fluffy person's soul. Scene goes back to Finn and Marceline.]
Finn: There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb! [Marceline drops him and he whistles to mimic a bomb falling; Marceline catches him before he reaches the ground and he makes an explosion noise. He notices the Fluffy People shivering.] They're all freaked out!
Marceline: It's because they're scared of him. [Camera pans over to the Fluffy Person from earlier. He is floating and moaning. Marceline examines him.] Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.
Finn: No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
[Finn tries to feed the Fluffy Person the food but he keeps moaning and doesn't eat it.]
Marceline: Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.
Finn: How will that help hi—?
Marceline: MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!
[Fluffy Person bumps into Finn.]
Finn: Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
Marceline: [Blows tuft of hair away from her face] Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.
[Scene cuts to the Marauder Village. The Marauders are sitting at a table talking.]
Head Marauder: So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"
[They all laugh. A noise is heard and they stop laughing.]
Lord of Evil: Alright.
Marauders: Huh?!
Lord of Evil: I've got a joke, too. [It's revealed that he sucked Marauder #14's soul. The Lord of Evil pushes him off the chair.] What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?
Head Marauder: Yo mama!
Lord of Evil: [Beat] That's right! I'm your mama! [Sucks the marauders' souls]
[Scene cuts back to Finn and Marceline.]
Marceline: Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.
Finn: We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
[Finn notices the Lord of Evil in the pass singing "Stompin' On Ants." The Lord of Evil then sucks the ants' souls. Finn tries to push the rock, but he notices that Marceline flew down to attack her father by herself instead. She hisses and charges, but misses her father who ducks.]
Lord of Evil: So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?
[Marceline charges, but her father parries the attack and forces her to a wall. Marceline hisses.]
Marceline: [Losing patience] Daddy...
[Marceline jumps on her father's shoulders.]
Lord of Evil: [Chuckles] Karate kick!! [Kicks Marceline off his shoulders; she lands on the ground hissing.]
Finn: Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
[Finn headbutts the rock to make it fall off the cliff and groans in pain. While fighting, Marceline and her father manage to evade the rock. Finn adopts a look of desperation. Marceline struggles to reclaim her bass.]
Lord of Evil: Karate chop!! [He chops her; she hisses.] You can't destroy me!
Marceline: [Hisses] [Calming down] No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you... [Angered] Look, just... stay out of my life!! [Floats away]
Lord of Evil: You're not even alive!
[Marceline rests next to Finn.]
Finn: You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
Marceline: [Sighs] I just want my dad to care about me.
[Finn frowns; scene shifts to the Ice Kingdom.]
Lord of Evil: Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.
Gunter: Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil: NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.
[He tries to suck its soul, but it slaps him.]
Gunter: Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil: [Kicks penguin away] Keep your crummy soul!
[Gunter flies through the air, crying, and is caught by the Ice King.]
Ice King: Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!
Gunter: [Pointing at Lord of Evil] Wenk.
[Lord of Evil sucks another penguin's soul.]
Ice King: Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter. [Flies over to Lord of Evil] You darest encroach upon my domain?! [Lord of Evil's face changes.] You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall— [Lord of Evil shows Ice King his terrifying face.] AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice! [Flies away]
[Lord of Evil sucks all of the penguins' souls and starts growing.]
Lord of Evil: YES!!
[Marceline and Finn are shown hurrying over.]
Finn: Aw, man! He's growing huge!
[Lord of Evil sucks some birds' souls; he begins sucking souls from all over Ooo.]
Finn: I'm gonna take 'im down!
Marceline: Finn, you're like an ant to him.
Finn: Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
Marceline: [Deadpan, amused] What?
Finn: [Stammers, embarrassed] You know! [Picking up Sword of the Dead] Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!! [Climbs up Lord of Evil's body] Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
Lord of Evil: Huh? [Not noticing Finn] Oh, Marceline. Still following me?
Marceline: I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!
Lord of Evil: [Flicks Finn off with ease] No, Marceline.
Finn: [Flying upwards] NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! [Descends and stabs the Lord of Evil in the head. Lord of Evil smiles at Finn and reveals his second, monster-like head. He falls while screaming and grabs hold of a tentacle. Lord of Evil tries to shake Finn off but he won't let go. Finn is grunting and screaming all the while.] Whoooaa!! [Lord of Evil stops shaking.] The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
Lumpy Space Princess: What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party!
Finn: Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
[Lord of Evil tries to knock Finn off with his appendage; Finn evades and struggles until he cuts off the appendage, making himself and the Ax bass fall; Marceline rushes over and catches the bass, letting Finn hit the ground.]
Marceline: IN YOUR FACE, DAD!
Lord of Evil: Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough!
Marceline: Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!
Finn: BUT—!!
Lord of Evil: Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!
Finn: NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
Marceline: I said I'm outta here!
Finn: [To himself and digging around in his backpack] Diversion... need... diversion. [He gasps, pulls out the Walkman and plays the song he and Marceline recorded earlier. Both Marceline and her father stop dead in their tracks. Marceline blushes and her father turns around.]
Lumpy Space Princess: Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!
Lord of Evil: Marceline, do you really feel this way?
Marceline: Dad, I...
[Finn sneaks closer to the Lord of Evil.]
Lord of Evil: Marceline... of course I love you.
Marceline: Dad...
Lord of Evil: I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Marceline: It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.
Lord of Evil: No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.
Marceline: I love you, too, Dad.
Lord of Evil: [Tearing up] Oh, Marceline, I am so—
Finn: [Flying through the air] YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!
[Finn stabs the Lord of Evil's soul sack with two swords making him scream in pain; the souls are released. Finn drops down and repeats the summoning process.]
Finn: MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!! [Lord of Evil is transported back to the Nightosphere.] [Low, growling voice] I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak. [Marceline gasps] YES!!!!
Marceline: Finn!! How could you do that?!
Finn: How could I... save the day?
Marceline: How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!
Finn: How could I embarrass-save you?? [Marceline attempts to ax Finn.] WHOA! Marceline!
Marceline: [Sighs] I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.
Finn: I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
[Finn falls down on the ground, exhausted. Marceline joins him. The souls are floating around the sky and Marceline chuckles at them.]
Marceline: I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?
Finn: Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?
[Jake rolls over, farts and the episode ends.]
