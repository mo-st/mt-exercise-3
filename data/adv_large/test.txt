&#91; Ice King pulls out a couple of sledgehammers . &#93;
Gentlemen , could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers ?
Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites .
Finn : &#91; Being gnawed by babies &#93; I &apos;ll take one .
Jake : Me too !
BMO : Great decision .
&#91; Ice King hands the hammers to Finn and Jake .
Finn taps one of the babies and it disintegrates with a poof .
He smashes a few more babies . &#93;
BMO : A little tap is all it takes .
Jake : &#91; Smashing babies &#93; These baby-smashing hammers are great .
&#91; They continue smashing all the babies .
Gumbald is seen outside , watching through a telescope .
After all the babies are smashed , Finn , Jake , and BMO begin sweeping up the mess . &#93;
BMO : I &apos;m sorry I caused such a mess .
It &apos;s very bad for business .
Ice King : Well , time to call it a day .
&#91; He pulls out a clocking-in machine and a punchcard , and clocks out , then places a small hat atop his crown . &#93;
The ice man leaveth .
BMO : Hey , wait .
See you tomorrow , partner .
&#91; They shake hands . &#93;
Ice King : Until tomorrow .
Finn : Yeah , you &apos;re not doing this tomorrow .
&#91; Ice King exits , whistling .
Gumbald watches through his telescope . &#93;
Gumbald : Hmm .
In retrospect , the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth .
&#91; Clears throat . &#93;
BMO : One free-range Humpty Dumpty .
BMO : Sorry .
BMO : Fine aged cheddar man .
BMO : Homemade ketchup .
BMO : A fresh pepper fart BMO : Dance , parsley .
BMO : Face bread .
BMO : Special sentient sandwich .
Jake : Mmm ... Is that special sentient sammich ?
BMO : Bingo .
BMO : Made by the BMO .
Jake : BMO , you &apos;re my little cherub .
Jake : You know that ?
Jake : You made all this for me , right ?
Jake : Aaahhh .
BMO : Not so fast , Jake !
Jake : Naaaw .
BMO : The sammiches are yours ... BMO : For a price .
Jake : What ?
BMO : I need you to be my tiny horse for the day , so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure .
Jake : No way .
Jake : Poo deal .
Jake : I &apos;ll do 20 minutes .
BMO : It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh , Jake !
BMO : Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the &quot; special market , &quot; putting my safety and my reputation on the line .
Jake : Okay , fine , fine .
Jake : Three sammiches for every hour I &apos;m a horse .
BMO : Mm ... BMO : One sammich per horse-hour , six-hour minimum .
Jake : Deal .
BMO : Yippee-ki-yay !
Jake : Om !
Jake : Mm .
Jake : Oh , yeah .
Jake : It tastes alive .
BMO : Steed yourself , partner .
Jake : Okay .
Jake : Om .
Jake : &apos; Kay .
BMO : Oh , come on , man .
BMO : You didn &apos;t even try .
Jake : I did try .
Jake : Horses are hard .
Jake : How &apos;s that ?
BMO : Eh , it reads .
BMO : Steady , girl .
Jake : Wha ... BMO : Shh , shh , shh .
BMO : I &apos;m going to mount you now .
BMO : Hup !
BMO : Good girl .
Jake : So , what &apos;s the plan anyway , BMO ?
BMO : The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps !
Jake : Ow .
BMO : Oh , and by the way , Jake , from now on , you can call me ... Angel Face .
BMO : Hyah !
Jake : Yow !
BMO : I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder .
BMO : Now I &apos;m the guy chasing those guys , yet the devil is still here , sleeping in my couch .
Jake : BMO , that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly .
Jake : Are you gonna apologize or ... BMO : Horses do not talk .
BMO : Over there !
Hyah !
BMO : Whoa !
BMO : Jackrabbit Johnson .
BMO : This guy &apos;s wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding .
BMO : Makes me sick .
BMO : He was last seen in dead goat gulch .
BMO : What do you say , girl ?
BMO : Want to catch this donkey and split the reward ?
Jake : You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich .
BMO : Time &apos;s a-wasting !
Jake : Hyee !
BMO : Hmm .
Jake : BMO , I &apos;m tired .
BMO : Looks like my horse needs a rest .
BMO : Slow down , horse .
BMO : ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪ BMO : ♪ Is a lonely job ♪ BMO : ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪ BMO : ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪ BMO : ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪ BMO : ♪ It &apos;s okay because I like them a lot ♪ BMO : ♪ That &apos;s okay , I like being a robot ♪ BMO : ♪ Cowboy ♪ BMO : Be careful , Jake .
BMO : This is where Jackrabbit Johnson &apos;s gang of lowlife bandits lays low .
BMO : Hyah !
BMO : Bang !
Bang !
BMO : Put them up , partner !
BMO : Hyah !
BMO : Pyew , pyew !
BMO : Pyew , pyew , pyew !
BMO : I want answers !
BMO : &#91; high voice &#93; You can &apos;t do this to us !
BMO : No answers , eh ?
BMO : No use to me !
BMO : How about you , frisco ?
BMO : &#91; high voice &#93; I &apos;m not going to talk .
BMO : Why am I talking to you then ? !
BMO : Hooah !
BMO : Yah !
Unh !
Neptr : BMO , what did you do ?
BMO : It &apos;s Jackrabbit Johnson &apos;s right-hand man , Tumbleweed Terk .
Neptr : I spent the last three months building all of this .
Jake : Oh , that &apos;s where you been ?
Neptr : Mm-hmm .
Neptr : BMO gave me a Finn Cake .
BMO : Don &apos;t talk to my horse , Tumbleweed .
Neptr : Aah .
BMO : Where is Jackrabbit Johnson ? !
BMO : I know you know where he &apos;s headed .
Neptr : I don &apos;t know !
Neptr : Tumbleweed terk &apos;s always the last to know .
Neptr : It &apos;s just like I told the other bounty hunter , I swear .
BMO : I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
BMO : Now take a message to your compadre .
BMO : Tell him his pal , Angel Face , is itching to get together .
BMO : Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats , just like the old days !
Neptr : Okay .
BMO : Sock citizens of dead goat gulch , we can rebuild !
Jake : Neigh !
Me-Mow : Grrr .
BMO : Uhh ... BMO : I don &apos;t remember where Dirtwater Flat is .
BMO : Better stop for the night .
BMO : We can make a campfire here .
BMO : And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money .
Jake : No .
Jake : It &apos;s been fun , BMO , but it &apos;s time to go home because there are no more sandwiches .
BMO : But I want to finish the adventure .
Jake : Which direction is the house ?
BMO : I &apos;m not sure .
BMO : Get down !
Me-Mow : Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins ... check .
Me-Mow : Capturing my first bounty ... Me-Mow : Check .
Me-Mow : Going to Finn and Jake &apos;s treehouse and getting revenge ... Me-Mow : Unchecked .
Finn : Finn and Jake &apos;s treehouse ?
Me-Mow : Mm-hmm .
Finn : Who are you , and why do you want to get revenge ?
Me-Mow : I ... Am ... Me-Mow !
Finn : Me-Mow ? !
Whoa .
Finn : You &apos;ve gotten bigger .
Me-Mow : Have we met before ?
Jake : Finn , is that you ?
BMO : That &apos;s Jackrabbit Johnson !
Me-Mow : Finn ?
Me-Mow : It is Finn !
Me-Mow : Tricked again !
Jake : Look ...
It &apos;s me-mow , BMO .
BMO : I don &apos;t care .
BMO : That &apos;s my bounty !
BMO : Yaah !
BMO : Jake , transform ... BMO : Horse !
Jake : Whoa , did you have a real gun all this time ?
BMO : I am old enough to vote .
Me-Mow : &#91; thinking &#93; Hey , Jake , if you can hear my internal monologue , I &apos;m going to kill you !
BMO : Your Daisy days are over !
BMO : I am the whaler &apos; round these parts !
BMO : Huh .
Me-Mow : Sounds like you &apos;re out of ammo .
BMO : No , you heard incorrectly .
BMO : Bang , bang , bang !
Me-Mow : I &apos;m coming for you !
Me-Mow : Ugh !
Me-Mow : Blast you , Finn and Jake and Angel Face .
Me-Mow : This prison cell &apos;s not going to hold me .
Finn : Oh ?
Me-Mow : Hey , Finn and Jake !
I &apos;ll get my revenge !
You hear me ? !
Revenge !
Finn : Hey , BMO , are you sure you took down all the wanted posters ?
BMO : Yes .
Armadillo : Stick &apos; em up .
Finn : Huh ?
BMO : This bounty belongs to me !
BMO : Get out of here !
Armadillo : Yaah !
Finn : Thanks , BMO .
BMO : You &apos;re welcome .
&#91; The scene opens to Finn and Jake &apos;s Tree Fort .
A bunch of Clown Nurses are acting around while circus music plays in the background .
The head Clown Nurse is sitting by Finn .
He is sitting in bed reading the Enchiridion , and his right foot is bandaged . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Who wants a cookie ?
&#91; She moves it around , making airplane sounds . &#93;
Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie ?
Finn : No thanks .
Head Clown Nurse : Now , come on , Finn .
You have to eat .
Open Sesame ... Finn : Uh , Jake , can &apos;t we get rid of these Clown Nurses ?
They make me feel ridiculous .
&#91; The camera cuts to Jake .
He , too , is sitting in bed , with his right foot bandaged .
A big Clown Nurse is standing near him . &#93;
Jake : No way , man .
&#91; Finn groans in disgust . &#93;
Jake : Well , now you know we can &apos;t jump off of birds .
&#91; The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around , mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake &apos;s mouth . &#93;
I paid them up front .
They don &apos;t leave until the job &apos;s done .
Besides ... &#91; He honks the big Clown Nurse &apos;s nose . &#93;
They &apos;re funny .
&#91; He honks the big Clown Nurse &apos;s nose again , and she farts this time . &#93;
&#91; laughs &#93; Look , she just farted .
Head Clown Nurse : Time for our love therapy .
Finn : Wait , what are they doing ?
&#91; The Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Whoa !
Stop !
Head Clown Nurse : &#91; gasps &#93; Oh my !
Did that hurt , dear ?
Finn : NO ! !
I just don &apos;t want you kissing my toe !
Head Clown Nurse : Now , now , honey , you gotta understand .
This is the only way to &quot; foo-foo &quot; your boo-boo .
Finn : What does that even mean ? ?
Jake : I don &apos;t know ... but I &apos;m feeling better already .
Ah .
That tickles .
Big Clown Nurse : You want me to stop ?
Jake : No , keep going .
&#91; The big Clown Nurse continues smooching Jake &apos;s toes . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Beat &#93; You &apos;re gross , man .
&#91; He notices a page in the Enchiridion . &#93;
Look !
Deep in the forest of trees , there &apos;s a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound .
See ?
See ?
&#91; The head Clown Nurse takes the book from him . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals , and my professional prescription is ... your toe needs crazy smooches !
It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The Clown Nurses all gather around and start holding Finn down . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Wha ?
&#91; The head Clown Nurse gets near Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Finn : Wait !
Wait !
Wait !
There &apos;s another way !
There &apos;s my way !
Let me show you my way !
&#91; The head Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Finn : Ahh !
Let me go !
&#91; The head Clown Nurse is still smooching Finn &apos;s foot .
He screams and then blacks out .
Finn starts having a crazy nightmare about running from Clown Nurses .
He trips and sees the head of the head Clown Nurse . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The head rises up and floats in front of him .
Finn screams and runs in panic , but ends up falling into the mouth of the Clown Nurse &apos;s head . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : &#91; softly &#93; It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; Finn wakes up .
The Head Clown Nurse is rapidly smooching Finn &apos;s foot .
Finn gets up and the Clown nurses back off . &#93;
Finn : MY WAY ! !
&#91; He runs out of the house and into the forest , screaming .
He finally comes to a stop .
He &apos;s staring at a tree stump with a sign .
The road splits up into two paths . &#93;
Finn : Hmmm ... Tree Stump : Ring , ring !
Look , there &apos;s only two choices , bro .
Take your pick .
There &apos;s the path on the left , Hair Fall-Out Path .
No more hair again , ever !
Or the path on the right , Smelly Path .
Makes you smelly forever .
Hoohoo , you won &apos;t believe it .
Finn : Isn &apos;t there another way ?
Tree Stump : Nope .
Finn : But what if I just went — Tree Stump : No , that &apos;s it !
You have to choose !
There &apos;s no other way !
Choosing is the only way .
Choosing — is the only — way .
&#91; The camera zooms in on Finn &apos;s face .
A thought of the head Clown Nurse crosses his mind . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; Finn suddenly screams and confronts the tree stump . &#93;
Tree Stump : Hey , listen man , the Smelly Path &apos;s not actually that bad !
Finn : NO !
I choose MY WAY ! !
&#91; He kicks the sign off of her head . &#93;
My way .
&#91; Finn runs right through the prickly bushes , screaming all the way .
He comes out on the other side , all scratched and covered in thorns .
He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank .
A bush is on the bank nearby . &#93;
Bush : Ring ring .
Hello , dummy police ?
Yes , there &apos;s a strange dummy lurking around my house .
Okay , yes .
Thank you .
Goodbye .
Finn : Wha ... ?
&#91; Beats &#93; I need to cross the river .
The Cyclops is over there .
Bush : You can &apos;t cross this river .
It &apos;s impossible !
Look !
The current is so fast , it &apos;ll turn your butt inside-out for real , doofus .
And the water &apos;s so acidic it &apos;ll crump your boat in half .
It &apos;s like orange juice .
It &apos;s gross .
There &apos;s a bridge , but it &apos;s a trap !
Plus , the water &apos;s jamming with electric eels .
Wow , so weird .
Anyway , that &apos;s it , there &apos;s no other way around , you dummy .
&#91; While the bush speaks , the camera shows the river &apos;s current flowing , and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away .
The bridge nearby is shown , then two pairs of eyes and shadowy arms pop out .
Two electric eels are swimming under the water , their bodies surging with electricity . &#93;
Finn : But I need to get across .
Bush : Listen what I &apos;m telling you .
There &apos;s no way .
... Ugly tramp .
&#91; Another thought of a Clown Nurse crosses Finn &apos;s mind .
He advances on the bush . &#93;
Finn : Glob , Glob it , Glob it , Glob it ... Bush : Huh ?
What are you saying ?
&quot; Globbit , Globbit &quot; ?
Who &apos;s Globbit ?
&#91; Finn snatches the bush and uproots him . &#93;
Finn : MY WAY ! !
&#91; A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river , using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath .
The bush is screaming in pain all the while .
Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn , shocking him and singing off the bush &apos;s leaves .
Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him .
Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water . &#93;
Bush : Glibby glob , man !
You &apos;re crazy !
We &apos;re not even half way across !
You gotta go back , man !
It &apos;s the only way , you ugly fat-smelling fat-head !
Finn : NO , MY WAY ! !
&#91; Frustrated , Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river .
Then he dives in .
He emerges from the river , screaming and steaming from the pineapple juice-like water .
He then happens upon a strange little man standing next to a wagon with watermelons in it . &#93;
Finn : &#91; panting &#93; MY WAY !
&#91; He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head . &#93;
Oh , Glob , oh , Glob , oh , Glob , oh , Glob .
Pan : Uhh , excuse me , friend .
&#91; Finn blabbers his lips together . &#93;
You &apos;re pretty tall , can you reach up there and get my wheel for me ?
Gotta get these melons home to my wife .
You know how it is .
&#91; Still frustrated as ever , Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon . &#93;
Finn : &#91; panting &#93; MY WAY !
&#91; He hurls the wagon down the hill .
The wagon shatters as it hits the ground , and the melons tumble down the hill . &#93;
Pan : Watch out , Rainy !
&#91; Rainy realizes too late .
She avoids the first one , which rolls over the wigwam house , but the others roll over her , injuring her .
Rainy groans in pain . &#93;
Pan : &#91; gasps &#93; Rainy !
Finn : Whoops .
Uh ... man , I &apos;m real sorry .
Pan : Yeah ?
&#91; sobs &#93; No doy ... friend .
Finn : But ...
I can still help .
I &apos;ll fix your house for you .
Pan : Just get out of here !
Leave us alone !
Finn : Uh ... wh ...
I ... &#91; sighs &#93; Pan : Psycho fink .
&#91; Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below .
He realizes his plan didn &apos;t go as well as he had hoped .
He takes off his hat and breaks out in song . &#93;
Finn : ♫ I was wrong .
Was I wrong ?
No .
Yes ...
Yes ...
I was wrong .
How could it be ?
I trusted in my guts , but ended up all nuts .
I was wrong .
How could it be ?
Listened to my brain , but ended up insane .
The melons rolled ... over that lady .
I went too far .
How could it be ?
&#91; Finn puts his hat back on . &#93;
How did I go ... too far ?
♫ &#91; As Finn finishes his song , the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff .
A giant eye opens up , looks up , and blinks .
Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff .
It &apos;s the Cyclops Finn has been seeking . &#93;
Forest Cyclops : Hey !
I know you &apos;re here for my magical tears , but you won &apos;t have any , because I never cry .
Finn : I don &apos;t want &apos; em anymore .
Forest Cyclops : What ?
Stop lying .
You &apos;re here for my tears , aren &apos;t you ?
Finn : No .
I hurt a small , hairy man &apos;s wife .
I just wanna go home .
Forest Cyclops : You &apos;re just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry ... but I &apos;ve got a heart of stone , buddy .
I &apos;m EVIL !
Finn : Dude !
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I said I don &apos;t want your tears !
Forest Cyclops : YOU &apos;RE LYING !
Finn : I &apos;M NOT LYING ! ! !
Forest Cyclops : &#91; Beat &#93; You stink at lying .
Finn : Fine .
Whatever , man .
Have it your way .
Forest Cyclops : Okay ...
I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY ! !
Finn : Huh ?
&#91; The Cyclops pounds him into the ground . &#93;
Forest Cyclops : Beg for mercy , or I &apos;ll kill you !
&#91; Finn glances up at the Cyclops &apos; eye .
He notices water forming up in the big , round eye . &#93;
Finn : &#91; mutters &#93; Forest Cyclops : Whuh ... What ?
Finn : &#91; mutters &#93; Forest Cyclops : What ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Finn : I said ... MY WAY ! !
&#91; Finn punches the Cyclops in the eye .
The Cyclops starts crying as he screams in pain .
Some of the tears fall onto Finn .
His clothes are made anew . &#93;
Finn : Magical tear drops .
&#91; He pulls off the bandage .
His foot has been healed completely .
He wiggles his toes . &#93;
My way can still work !
Yeah !
&#91; Finn pulls off the Cyclops &apos; head .
Finn first goes to Pan , who is still sobbing .
Finn pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over Rainy , who is restored . &#93;
Rainy : Huh ?
I &apos;m okay .
Pan : Yay !
&#91; Finn runs off .
He then goes to the bare bush and pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over him . &#93;
Bush : Huh ?
&#91; The bush takes root , and all his leaves regrow . &#93;
Whoa !
&#91; The stump is sobbing in pain from having her sign knocked off .
Finn pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over her , and a flower grows where the sign was . &#93;
Tree Stump : Huh ?
Whoo-hoo .
&#91; Finally , Finn pours Cyclops &apos; tears over a ham sandwich at a picnic , bringing it to life . &#93;
Ham Sandwich : Yeah !
&#91; The scene cuts back to the Tree Fort , where the Clown Nurses are still doing their so-called duties .
The big Clown Nurse is still kissing Jake &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Jake : Oh , yeah .
Huh ?
&#91; The door suddenly slams open .
Everyone gasps in shock .
Finn walks in , still carrying the Cyclops &apos; head . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Have you come crying back for your proper treatment , Babylips ?
&#91; Finn throws the Cyclops &apos; head .
It lands in front of the head Clown Nurse , who gasps . &#93;
Finn : Kiss that !
Head Clown Nurse : Oh , my !
You look horribly injured !
My kisses will make heal you .
&#91; She smooches the Cyclops &apos; eye . &#93;
Now how does that feel ?
Forest Cyclops : Bittersweet .
&#91; Finn walks over to Jake , carrying a bottle of Cyclops &apos; tears . &#93;
Finn : Hey , man .
You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo ?
Jake : Ah , no thanks .
I think the kisses work better .
&#91; To nurse &#93; Excuse me , don &apos;t stop , keep going , please .
&#91; The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching Jake &apos;s foot . &#93;
Finn : You &apos;re gross .
Jake : Hey !
We all have our own ways .
Finn : &#91; realizing &#93; You know what ?
You &apos;re ... right .
&#91; Jake &apos;s eyes twinkle .
The episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins in the Tree Fort &apos;s kitchen , where Jake is preparing a meal . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sets table &#93; Finn , lunch is ready !
Finn : &#91; holds nose &#93; Ugh , what are you cooking ?
Jake : It &apos;s good !
I learned it from Rainicorn .
Finn : I &apos;m not eatin &apos; that .
It smells funny .
Jake : Dude , this took me , like — Finn : Let &apos;s go over to Tree Trunks &apos;s and get some apple pie !
Apple pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Let &apos;s go !
&#91; grabs Jake &apos;s arm &#93; Jake : Whoa !
&#91; grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves &#93; Eh .
&#91; Scene changes to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Finn : &#91; knocking on door &#93; Tree Trunks !
&#91; opens door and walks in with Jake &#93; &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table , motionless . &#93;
Finn : &#91; running over to her &#93; Tree Trunks !
Tree Trunks ?
Tree Trunks : &#91; mumbling &#93; Apples ... my apples ... Jake : Apples ?
Tree Trunks : You !
&#91; jumps at Jake &#93; You took my apples !
&#91; starts hitting Jake &#93; Finn : Whoa , whoa !
&#91; grabs Tree Trunks &#93; Tree Trunks , it &apos;s us , Finn and Jake !
Tree Trunks : Finn ... and , and Jake ?
Finn : It &apos;s okay , Tree Trunks .
We &apos;re here to help you .
Just tell us what happened .
Tree Trunks : &#91; tearing up &#93; They took &apos; em .
They took all of &apos; em .
Jake : All of what ?
Tree Trunks : Apples .
My apples that I raised with love from , from mere seedlings .
Without my special apples , I won &apos;t be able to bake any more apple pies .
Finn &amp; Jake : NOOOOOOOO !
Finn : Don &apos;t you worry , Tree Trunks .
We &apos;ll find those thieves and bring them to justice .
Tree Trunks : Let me show you the crime scene .
&#91; leads them outside &#93; You see , boys : scads of apple trees but , but no apples .
Finn : Hmm .
Is anything else missing , Tree Trunks ?
Tree Trunks : No , Finn , they didn &apos;t touch my rocks , or my birds , or my flowers , or , or nothing .
Finn : Hm .
Well , I don &apos;t see any footprints .
What &apos;cha got , Jake ?
Jake : &#91; patting the air &#93; No ghost doodies .
Oh .
Oh , wait .
&#91; feeling something invisible &#93; Oh , no .
No .
Finn : Hm .
Tree Trunks , is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up ?
Tree Trunks : Oh , no , Finn .
I take great care to assure that-that I &apos;m loved by even the most heinous cretins — Jake : Hey , guys , I found something !
Look !
&#91; Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Uh !
Raggedy Princess : Oh , heheh , hey , Finn .
Heheh .
Finn : Oh , hey , Raggedy Princess .
Have you seen anything fishy going on ?
Raggedy Princess : Um , no , heheh .
I &apos;ve been kinda down in this hole for a long time .
&#91; laughs nervously &#93; I got knocked down here by some ne &apos;er-do-wells .
It was terrible .
I was so scared .
Tree Trunks : Ne &apos;er-do-wells ?
They stole my apples .
&#91; flapping ears &#93; I &apos;m gonna sass those boys up nasty !
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Awesome .
Where do we find these guys ?
Jake : Oh , the Candy Tavern , man .
I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies &apos; purses .
Finn : &#91; jaw drops with &quot; brring &quot; sound effect &#93; Jake : Don &apos;t worry , I stopped doing that a long time ago .
I didn &apos;t know it was wrong .
Finn : &#91; jaw still hanging , with higher &quot; brring &quot; sound effect &#93; Tree Trunks : Okay , you two , let &apos;s get going .
&#91; Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern .
Someone gets thrown out of the window . &#93;
Candy Tavern Person : Whoa !
Tree Trunks : &#91; gasps &#93; Oh , my !
&#91; The three enter the tavern .
A Candy Person at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon , and an angry cookie shakes . &#93;
Finn : Uh , does Princess Bubblegum know about this place ?
Jake : Be cool , man .
You &apos;re gonna queer the deal .
Finn : Oh , yeah .
Try not to act suspicious , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : Okay , I won &apos;t .
&#91; The three walk up to the Candy Tavern Bartender . &#93;
Finn &amp; Tree Trunks : Where — ?
Finn : Oh .
&#91; motions for Tree Trunks to continue &#93; Tree Trunks : Where &apos;s my dang apples ?
Finn : Oh , &#91; laughs &#93; Tree Trunks , you &apos;re so silly .
But , but listen , you wouldn &apos;t happen to have seen any — I don &apos;t know — apples around , have you ?
Bartender : &quot; Seen any apples ? &quot;
Y &apos;all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions ... almost like you &apos;re trying to solve somethin &apos; .
Finn : What ?
Oh , no-no-no-no-no-no .
Bartender : Mmm ... clean , too .
Almost like some &#91; pounds bar &#93; do-gooders !
Jake : Hold on , we gotta go potty .
&#91; The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies . &#93;
Finn : Dang .
They almost got us , but I think we blend in pretty well now .
Tree Trunks : &#91; licking toilet paper &#93; This , this toilet paper &apos;s drying my mouth all up .
Finn : Uh , Tree Trunks , don &apos;t eat that .
&#91; sighs &#93; Here .
&#91; holds her up to the mirror &#93; &#91; whispers to Jake &#93; You gotta watch her , man !
Tree Trunks : Oh , I look just like an army brat !
&#91; The three return to the bartender . &#93;
Bartender : What can I do for you ?
Finn : &#91; pouring drink onto bar &#93; You know where a guy might maybe score some apples ?
&#91; drops mug onto the floor , shattering it &#93; Bartender : Well , when you put it like that .... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale .
I &apos;ll show you .
&#91; He leads them to a back door and opens it to a tall gingerbread man and an upside-down ice cream cone . &#93;
Bartender : Hey , fellas , these folks been askin &apos; &apos; bout your ... apples ?
Jaybird : &#91; scratches chin &#93; Okay , show &apos; em the apples , Smudge .
&#91; Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake . &#93;
Jaybird : Grab &apos; em !
&#91; The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks . &#93;
Jaybird : You go back , and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples &apos; cause they &apos;re ours now !
Finn : Wha-what boss ?
Jaybird : Your boss !
Dr. J ?
Finn : We don &apos;t know any Dr. J. Jaybird : &#91; punches Finn &apos;s forehead &#93; Liars !
Come on , Smudge &#91; walks off &#93; &#91; mumbling &#93; ... gonna take my apples .
&#91; The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door .
Jake takes the trash can off . &#93;
Jake : What just happened ?
Finn : I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks &apos; apples also stole Dr. J &apos;s apples , and they thought we were workin &apos; for him !
Tree Trunks : Finn ?
Finn .
Finn : Hm ?
Tree Trunks : This could be dangerous , a-and if you want to go back home , I understand , but I need to do this .
Finn : Yeah , Tree Trunks , me too .
Jake : Hey , Finn .
Finn : Hm ?
Jake : &#91; pointing to mark &#93; What &apos;s that on your face , buddy ?
Finn : Oh , that guy bopped me one .
Must &apos;ve had a ring on .
Jake : Y &apos;know , I think I seen that symbol somewhere before .
Yeah , right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes .
Finn : What ? !
Jake : I didn &apos;t know it was wrong .
&#91; Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom . &#93;
Jake : &#91; points to a building with the mark &#93; Yeah , you see ?
That guy must work here or somethin &apos; .
&#91; The three walk up to the building . &#93;
Finn : &#91; knocks on the door &#93; Hello ?
Wormo : &#91; through door &#93; Who &apos;s the heck happening ?
What ?
Finn : Uh , we &apos;re here about the apples ?
Wormo : Oh , okay .
Let &apos;s see your ring .
Finn : Um ... Jake : Here .
&#91; forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo &#93; Wormo : &#91; opens door &#93; Come on in .
Follow this guy .
&#91; leads them in &#93; &#91; Before the door closes , someone stops it with their foot . &#93;
Wormo : &#91; leading them downstairs &#93; My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples .
A whole crate .
&#91; shows them a crate of diamonds &#93; Finn : What the ?
Wormo : What &apos;s wrong , guy ?
Finn : These aren &apos;t apples .
Wormo : Oh , ya didn &apos;t mean diamonds ?
All ne &apos;er-do-wells call diamonds &quot; apples . &quot;
Like calling money &quot; bread &quot; or rock-knockers &quot; butter-slaps . &quot;
Jaybird : &#91; opening door &#93; Hey , Wormo , we &apos;re back — what the ? !
&#91; points to Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks &#93; What are they doing here ?
Wormo : They &apos;re here for the apples .
Jaybird : That &apos;s the dang Dr. J gang , Wormo !
Grab &apos; em !
&#91; Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks are tied up . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Um , sir ?
&#91; laughs nervously &#93; I promise if you let us go , we won &apos;t tell no one about your apples .
Wormo : Feed &apos; em to the pig .
Smudge : Yeah , the pig .
Jaybird : Heheh , yeah , all right .
&#91; walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr.
Pig &#93; Mr.
Pig : Uh , I &apos;m sorry , y &apos;all .
They &apos;re makin &apos; me do this .
I-I &apos;ll try to make it quick .
Dr. J : Hold it !
&#91; Dr. J and his gang appear . &#93;
Jaybird : Dr. J !
&#91; drops pig &#93; Dr. J : Yeah , yeah , and I want my apples back .
Jaybird &amp; Dr. J : &#91; in unison &#93; Get &apos; em , boys !
&#91; While the gangs fight , Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope , and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; starts sobbing &#93; Finn : Aw , don &apos;t cry , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : But we &apos;re never gonna find those apples .
Mr.
Pig : Apples ?
You guys looking for apples ?
Jake : Uh , yeah , why ?
Mr.
Pig : &apos; Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room .
Jake : Wait , you mean &quot; apples &quot; as &quot; diamonds &quot; ?
Mr.
Pig : No .
Jake : &quot; Apples &quot; as &quot; apples &quot; ?
Mr.
Pig : Yep .
Finn : You mean apples that we eat ?
Mr.
Pig : Yes .
Tree Trunks : With all due respect , Mr.
Pig , sir , my apples were stolen by a dirty , rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail .
Mr.
Pig : I &apos;m just telling you the facts , ma &apos;am .
What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet .
&#91; points to wardrobe &#93; They sound scared .
Tree Trunks : Well , I hate to tell you this , boys , but there &apos;s no apples in this closet .
&#91; sticks tail into keyhole &#93; You see , uh , I &apos;m the only one who knows how to open this closet .
&#91; opens it &#93; &#91; Dozens of apples spill out . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; gasp &#93; Tree Trunks : Oh , so I was the apple thief after all .
Finn : No , Tree Trunks , that &apos;s preposterous .
Tree Trunks : No , Finn , I &apos;m a criminal , &#91; picks up phone and dials 911 &#93; and I need to pay the price .
Banana Guard &#91; over phone &#93; : Banana Guard speaking .
Tree Trunks : Uh , this is Tree Trunks .
I &apos;ve done somethin &apos; horrible , and I want you to come over and arrest me .
&#91; Finn and Jake exchange sad looks . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to outside the house , with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by . &#93;
Finn : Tree Trunks , you don &apos;t need to do this .
Tree Trunks : Thank you , Finn and Jake , but I won &apos;t let myself slip away from such a terrible crime .
Goodbye .
Finn : Tree Trunks .
Banana Guard : Ah , this is hard to watch .
I &apos;m gonna look away .
&#91; Several crows fly out of the forest . &#93;
Banana Guard : This place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : Huh ?
Wait , what &apos;d you say ?
Banana Guard : Uh , I-I said this place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : A scarecrow , no footprints , all those magpies on the roof , Raggedy Princess in the ditch , and all the apples in Tree Trunks &apos;s closet .
Banana Guard &#91; in Finn &apos;s memory &#93; : Boy , this place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : That &apos;s it !
&#91; climbs onto Tree Trunks &apos; house &apos;s roof &#93; I knew it !
&#91; A nest is next to a hole in the roof .
A magpie brings an apple to its chicks , but the apple falls into the hole . &#93;
Finn : The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole !
Jake : And that &apos;s why there weren &apos;t any footprints around the tree !
Finn : Yes .
And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn &apos;t sitting on the fence post to scare them off !
Tree Trunks : Does this mean I &apos;m innocent ?
Jake : As innocent as a baby &apos;s butt cheek !
Finn : &#91; jumps off roof &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; Awesome !
This calls for a celebration !
You know what that means , Tree Trunks !
Tree Trunks : I &apos;ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted .
&#91; strains and breaks the handcuffs &#93; Banana Guards : Whoa .
Tree Trunks : &#91; to Banana Guards &#93; Uh , you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie .
&#91; slaps Banana Guard &#93; Banana Guard : She slapped my butt !
&#91; The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The others join in . &#93;
&#91; Cinnamon Bun , in a tuxedo , walks while carrying a tray of apple cider to Princess Bubblegum . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Cinnamon Bun , what the heck are you doing out in the woods ? !
I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us .
Cinnamon Bun : Oh , oh , &quot; around for us . &quot;
I thought you said &quot; walk to the zoo and back &quot; !
Princess Bubblegum : Gob .
&#91; smacks forehead &#93; &#91; Cinnamon Bun walks away and Princess Bubblegum sighs and follows him to Finn . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Finn , Cinnamon Bun &apos;s gonna attend your juice bar now .
I have a special job for you .
&#91; Finn walks out . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : As Ooo &apos;s greatest champion , I &apos;m relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding .
I went ahead and deputized you .
&#91; hands a badge to Finn &#93; So , you know , no holds barred , got it ?
Finn : &#91; giggles &#93; Yeah .
Oh , what about Jake ?
Princess Bubblegum : Well , honestly I haven &apos;t seen Jake this happy in a while .
&#91; Jake is being tickled by 5 baby pigs . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I kinda don &apos;t want squash his groove .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum opens a door . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Knock , knock .
Hey , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : Oh , hey , Princess .
Wow , you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; giggles and closes the door behind her &#93; Thanks , Tree Trunks .
Now listen , I don &apos;t want you to worry about a thing .
I &apos;ve got Finn on LSP Deputy , and we &apos;re keeping your ex-husbands , Randy , Danny and Wyatt , a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it &apos;s time for me to perform the ceremony .
Tree Trunks : Oh , well , uh , Princess , I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all , but you can &apos;t perform the ceremony .
Princess Bubblegum : What ? !
Why not ?
Tree Trunks : Uh , well , I &apos;m sorry , but I just don &apos;t recognize your quote unquote &quot; authority &quot; on such matters .
I can only be married by His Holiness , the One True King of Ooo .
Princess Bubblegum : WHAT ?
That fraud ? !
Tree Trunks : Now I know ... Princess Bubblegum : That fraud is here ? !
Tree Trunks : Why , yes , but ... &#91; Princess Bubblegum leaves and slams the door . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Oh , dear .
Mama , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve offended the Princess .
Tree Trunks &apos; mother : Oh , nonsense , baby .
She &apos;s probably jealous &apos; cause you &apos;re about to marry a handsome , fine , saucy man .
Oh , but he is a saucy , fine bologna factory .
Mmmhmm , tell you what : I &apos;d like to open up that hood , see how the bologna gets made !
Tree Trunks : Mama , please !
Please don &apos;t call him a saucy fine bologna factory !
