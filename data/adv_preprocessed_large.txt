&#91; Finn and Jake are sitting atop a cliff made from a decrepit skyscraper overlooking a body of water &#93; Finn : Hey , Jake , do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who ’ s like your opposite ?
Jake : I don ’ t know .
I ’ m the &quot; first come first serve &quot; kinda guy .
Get in line , ladies !
This Rainicorn thing can ’ t last forever !
&#91; chuckles &#93; &#91; Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass , unnoticed by Finn and Jake &#93; I didn ’ t mean that .
Don ’ t spread that around .
Finn : So it ’ s not good to weigh someone ’ s qualities against your own ?
Jake : Well , no .
I mean , if you feel something , you feel something !
&#91; Jake ’ s head turns into a graph and his hand an upward moving arrow &#93; It ’ s not about personality matrixals and charts , it ’ s all about the bu-bumps in your heart !
&#91; His head is a heart shape that beats every time he say “ bumps ” or “ pumps ” .
He gets extremely close to Finn and his eyes are bugging out &#93; You can ’ t stop the pumps and bumps !
Pumps and bumps !
Pumps and bumps !
&#91; Finn chuckles , as does Magic Man &#93; Finn : Alright , well , what about BMO and Ice King ?
Jake : What about them ?
&#91; Looks confused &#93; Finn : Would they make a good couple ?
Jake : Whoa !
Wait !
Did BMO say something to you ?
Finn : No no !
Jake : Oh , I see .
You ’ re being weird .
&#91; Magic man reaches down into his hole and pulls out a bag &#93; Finn : It ’ s not that weird !
Come on !
Magic Man &#91; quietly &#93; : Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law .
Jake : BMO and Ice King ?
&#91; Magic man puts the bag on the outside of Finn ’ s pants &#93; Finn : Yeah !
Magic Man &#91; quietly &#93; : I ’ m not coming back .
&#91; Retreats into his hole &#93; Jake : You ’ re creepin ’ me out .
&#91; Gets up &#93; Finn : I ’ m just thinkin ’ out loud .
&#91; Jake starts walking away and Finn bends forward so he can see Jake between his legs &#93; What , can ’ t think out loud ?
&#91; Finn is walking back home with Jake &#93; Jake : Oh , is that what you ’ re doing ?
Finn : Yeah man !
Pffft , jeez don ’ t be judgy .
Jake : I ’ m not !
Finn : Yeah , you are !
Jake : How could you know that ?
Finn : I can hear it in your tone .
Jake : You can ?
&#91; in a mocking tone &#93; Finn : Yeah , wise-guy .
Jake : &#91; Pointing to the bag &#93; Hey , what ’ s that in your pants ?
Finn : &#91; Looking at the back of his pants &#93; What ? !
Not again !
&#91; Finn sees the bag on the other side &#93; Oh .
I don ’ t know .
&#91; Finn grabs the bag &#93; Whoa , look .
Jake : Crazy .
&#91; Finn opens the bag and reaches in &#93; Careful , dude .
Finn : What the-- ?
&#91; Finn pulls out his hand with Princess Bubblegum , Lumpy Space Princess , BMO , Jake , and himself &#93; Jake : What the heck ? !
Are they alive ? !
&#91; They are now moving around aimlessly &#93; Finn : Hey , are you guys alive ?
&#91; BMO starts to fall off , but Jake catches him &#93; I don ’ t know , man , I think they ’ re some kind of magic toy .
Jake : Maybe it ’ s black magic .
Maybe we shouldn ’ t mess with them .
Finn : No , man , look !
That ’ s you !
&#91; Jake is playing the viola with Lumpy Space Princess on his back and Finn and BMO are dancing to the music &#93; You ’ re totally shedding on the viola .
Jake : Yeah , that ’ s good .
How many more thingies are in there ?
Finn : &#91; Looks in the bag &#93; Dude .
Like a lot .
Come on !
Let ’ s check this out at the house .
&#91; They run towards the house &#93; Jake : I ’ ll make a special spagot &#91; spaghetti &#93; with a new sauce .
&#91; Finn is at the table while Jake is cooking the spaghetti .
He dumps out some of the little people onto the table &#93; Finn : Sheesh .
So many .
PB , you hang out with Lady .
&#91; Picks up Princess Bubblegum and moves her towards Lady &#93; C-listers , go back in the bag .
&#91; Pushes Xergiok , Donny , Tiffany , Lemongrab , one of the Gumdrop lasses , and &apos;Turtle Princess &#93; Jake : &#91; stirring the noodles &#93; Who ’ s in the C-list ?
&#91; Adds something , possibly wine , from a bottle , then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate &#93; Finn : Tiffany , Donny .
&#91; To himself &#93; Well , he ’ s okay .
&#91; Out loud &#93; Xergiok ... a bunch o &apos; these guys !
Jake : That ’ s not very nice .
&#91; Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table &#93; Finn : Don ’ t worry , man .
They ’ ll get involved eventually .
Jake : Involved with what ?
&#91; Sits down and gives Finn his food &#93; Finn : I don ’ t know .
Involved .
Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum !
Jake : &#91; Stretches to get forks .
Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation .
It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions &#93; What are they talkin ’ about ?
Finn : It ’ s hard to say , but I think it ’ s got something to do with Lady being preggos &#91; pregnant &#93; .
Jake : Whoa !
What kinda narrative are you trying to create here ? !
Finn : That ’ s your narrative , buddy .
Jake : Alright , well , what else ya got goin ’ on ?
Finn : Hmm .
Not much really .
I got Ice King over here .
&#91; Points to Ice King &#93; Jake : Ice King ?
He ’ s not C-list ?
Finn : &#91; Looking through the bag to find Ice King &apos;s drum kit &#93; Yeah , well , I saw his drum kit in here .
Here we go .
&#91; Puts it in front of Ice King &#93; Okay , jam out , little Ice King .
&#91; Ice King starts playing &#93; Jake : &#91; Little Jake sees the Ice King playing and runs over to him to join in &#93; No .
Don ’ t play with that hack .
Aww , man .
Hmm .
&#91; Jake looks surprised &#93; They ’ ve got good chemistry .
Who ’ d have guessed ?
Finn : Chemistry ... &#91; Finn looks as though he just had a good idea .
He looks at several groups of toy people .
Ice King and Jake playing together .
Marceline and Hunson Abadeer in the background with Finn stealing Lemongrab ’ s Lemon Camel in the foreground .
Mr. Cupcake exercising .
Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess playing cards &#93; Jake : Hey , Finn , eat the food before it gets cold .
&#91; Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess &#93; I made a new sauce !
Umm , earth to Finn , are you okay ?
Finn : Yeees .
&#91; Later on , Finn is now awake , but in bed with Jake fast asleep .
Finn looks over at Jake to make sure he ’ s asleep .
Confident that he ’ s asleep , he grabs the bag from under his pillow and retreats into his sleeping bag .
He takes the lens off a flashlight and puts it in front of him .
Then he takes Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess out .
Mr. Cupcake starts flexing and Lumpy Space Princess is impressed .
Finn chuckles .
Lumpy Space Princess looks enamored and begins working her lumps .
Mr. Cupcake and Lumpy Space Princess start kissing &#93; Finn : Whoooooa .
&#91; Finn looks curious and takes away Lumpy Space Princess .
Mr. Cupcake looks surprised .
Finn looks and the bag and then mixes it .
Finn grabs Lady and then checks to make sure Jake is still asleep .
He then puts Lady next to Mr. Cupcake .
Mr. Cupcake starts flexing , but Lady ignores him and grazes a piece of Finn ’ s sleeping bag .
When he sees nothing is happening , he pushes Lady into Mr. Cupcakes arms .
Mr. Cupcake wiggles his eyebrows and Lady laughs . &#93;
&#91; Finn then grabs Jake and contemplates what he ’ s about to do .
He looks a bit concerned .
Lady and Mr. Cupcake are kissing and Finn puts Jake right in front of them .
Jake doesn ’ t notice , but Finn moves his head around to see them .
Then Jake starts yelling “ wah ” .
Mr. Cupcake drops Lady and she acts with indignation towards Jake .
Jake argues back and then Mr. Cupcake starts yelling at Jake .
Jake pushes him and Lady pleads that they not fight .
Finn looks towards the bag and then looks back with realization .
He empties out the bag .
The scene ends . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Jake wakes up and heads down stairs .
Finn is sitting at the dinner table with a multitude of Jay T. Doggzone books arranged into a little town &#93; You ’ re up early .
Finn : I didn ’ t sleep .
&#91; Very blunt and tired &#93; Jake : &#91; Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug &#93; You stay up all night readin ’ trash books ?
&#91; Finn makes a weak “ meh ” sound . &#93;
I told you , man .
Those datin ’ books .
&#91; Sips drink &#93; That stuff is mess you up .
&#91; Drinks again &#93; Finn : I ’ m not reading .
I ’ m playing with the little wees .
Jake : Oh , let me see little me .
&#91; Stretches his head to find little Jake is sitting by himself next to an open book &#93; Me look so lonely .
Hey , Finn , pass me little Lady .
Finn : Uh , you guys broke up .
Jake : &#91; Confused &#93; Wha ?
Finn : She ’ s with someone else now .
Jake : &#91; Angry &#93; Who ? !
Finn : He ’ s a cool guy , don ’ t worry about it .
Jake : &#91; Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source .
He finds little Finn in Lady ’ s lap kissing under a book teepee &#93; Ahhhhhh !
&#91; Slams his fists on the table &#93; What the ball , man ? !
Finn : &#91; Laughs and shrugs ; he doesn ’ t sound as worn out as before &#93; What ?
Jake : What ?
What do ya think “ what ” ? !
Finn : Come on , they ’ re not real , they ’ re like toys .
These guys here , they ’ re goin ’ out .
&#91; Points the Marceline and Peppermint Butler in a tea cup .
Marceline licks the red off of Peppermint Butler ’ s side . &#93;
Pretty serious .
And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl .
They ’ re still testing the waters .
&#91; Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl are dancing and are joined by Abracadaniel &#93; But I think things are gonna work out .
Check out Xergiok and Turtle P. &#91; Turtle Princess is seen lightly spanking Xergiok .
Finn laughs . &#93;
Weird .
But cool .
Right , Jake ?
Jake : &#91; slowly backs towards the exit &#93; I don ’ t like where you ’ re going with this .
It ain ’ t wholesome .
I ’ m gonna go to Lady ’ s for a few days .
To clear my head .
&#91; Leaves &#93; Finn : Okay .
Whatever whatevs .
&#91; Goes over to little Finn and Lady and chuckles &#93; Weird .
&#91; Grabs little Finn and Flame Princess &#93; Huh ?
&#91; Finn puts both of them near each other , but nothing happens .
Finn breaks off part of a cookie and puts in on little Finn ’ s head .
He grabs it and Flame Princess yawns .
Finn uses a pencil to move little Finn ’ s legs to walk towards Flame Princess .
Flame Princess is pleasantly surprised to see little Finn and giggles .
Little Finn breaks part of the cookie crumb off and gives it to Flame Princess .
They then start to eat each end of what ’ s left .
Lady comes out of her teepee to see little Finn and Flame Princess and starts crying hysterically and runs back to the book house &#93; &#91; Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn .
At first they awkwardly stand around , but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum ’ s hand onto little Finn ’ s shoulder .
She begins massaging his shoulders and he likes it .
Real Finn looks around nervously to make sure no one can see what he ’ s doing .
Then they kiss and Flame Princess is outraged .
She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back .
Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation , but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum .
Princess Bubblegum ’ s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady ’ s teepee .
Using Lady as a kind of hose , the water being her tears , Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess .
They begin fighting and real Finn is astonished and begins blushing . &#93;
&#91; A card that reads &quot; 16 WEEKS LATER &quot; comes up . &#93;
Jake : I ’ m back !
I got over all that messed up stuff you did .
&#91; The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful &#93; Yeesh .
You okay , man ?
Finn : I don ’ t know .
&#91; Little Finn is standing on top of a book staring into the distance &#93; Jake : What ’ s little Finn doing ?
Finn : He ’ s ... thinking .
Jake : &#91; Looks concerned &#93; He looks sad .
What ’ s he thinking about ?
Finn : I don ’ t know .
Probably lots of stuff .
Jake : Where ’ s little Rainicorn ?
Finn : Probably still crying .
Jake : Wha ?
Finn : She ’ s not handling the break-up very well .
Jake : &#91; sees Lady still crying in her teepee &#93; Aww .
Finn : PB &apos;s good , though .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned .
She looks very angry . &#93;
After little Finn dumped her , she started working out .
Looks like she ’ s really into it .
Jake : This is messed up , dude .
You ’ ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff .
Finn : &#91; Looks perturbed &#93; I know !
Jake : &#91; Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler &#93; The destruction !
&#91; Xergiok looks like he ’ s in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him &#93; The depravity !
&#91; Choose Goose , Abracadaniel , and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together &#93; The wrongness of it all !
I ’ m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it .
&#91; Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms . &#93;
Finn : No , man !
I gotta fix this mess !
Look at me , man !
I ’ m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole !
I gotta help him !
Jake : You can ’ t !
Just let them do their own biz , man !
Finn : I junked them up too hard though !
I gotta step in !
Jake : How would ya do that ?
Finn : &#91; Lets go of his arms and Jake steps back &#93; I ’ m gonna talk to him .
Jake : But he can ’ t hear you .
Finn : Yeah , why is that ?
Jake : Hmm .
Maybe we ’ re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror .
So we can see him , but he can ’ t see us .
Finn : &#91; Gets really close to little Finn &#93; Lemme try this .
Finn !
Can you hear me ?
&#91; Sticks his tongue out while talking and pokes little Finn a few times &#93; We ’ re connected !
FINN !
&#91; Little Finn is shown standing as the same cliff shown in the beginning of the episode and talks as though he ’ s depressed &#93; Jake : Try shakin ’ him .
Finn : Why ?
Jake : Maybe we ’ re vibrating on different intervals .
Try shakin ’ him at different speeds and see if he responds .
Finn : &#91; Grabs him and starts shaking &#93; Okay .
Fiiiiiiinn !
Fiiiiiiiiiinn !
Jake : Now go faster !
Finn : FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN !
&#91; In the Little People &apos;s world , some clouds begin to form a crude Finn head . &#93;
Jake : Faster !
Finn : &#91; The cloud Finn says this in the Little People &apos;s world &#93; FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN !
&#91; The clouds dissipate and little Finn looks surprised &#93; Jake : Go slower , he saw you !
Finn : Okay .
&#91; In the Little People ’ s world &#93; Fiiiinn .
Can you hear me ?
Little Finn : Wah wah wah .
Jake : Whoa !
Neat !
Finn : I made you do those crummy things .
I ’ m why yous guys is fighting .
I ’ m the big you .
I came to apologize .
I will never interfere with your lives again .
&#91; Little Finn asks a question &#93; Don ’ t worry I will take care of it .
&#91; The clouds dissipate and then reassemble &#93; Sorry , my arm got tired .
&#91; Little Finn is confused by this . &#93;
Never mind .
It ’ ll be fine .
Goodbye , little Finn !
I ’ m not coming back !
Jake : Now what ?
Finn : &#91; shaking Lady , Princess Bubblegum , and Flame Princess at the same time and they all see the cloud &#93; Hey , ladies !
This is big Finn !
I caused all the problems !
It wasn ’ t anyone ’ s fault !
Don ’ t be mad at each other !
Have a … dance party !
Okay , goodbye !
I ’ m not coming back !
&#91; Finn pulls a stereo out of the bag and starts the music .
The three of them begin dancing and with the others . &#93;
Jake : Is that gonna do it ?
&#91; The little people join the party and start dancing &#93; Get the C-listers out .
&#91; They begin dancing as well &#93; Good party .
Oh , flip !
&#91; BMO and the Ice King are dancing &#93; Look who ’ s hittin ’ it off with the Ice King !
&#91; Chuckles &#93; &#91; Princess Bubblegum is in her lab working on a circuit board when a cloaked bird drops a letter on her table and flies away . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : What the ... &#91; she breaks the seal on the letter and reads it aloud &#93; &quot; mmmmn Princess Bubblegum , we are starving , immediately send us all of your candy .
How dare you , ours , Lemon Grabs . &quot;
&#91; stops reading &#93; Bull gunk !
I left them a lifetime supply of candy !
&#91; She swivels her chair to the window and looks out at Jake and Cinnamon Bun having a picnic , with Finn watching in the bushes . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Hey Finn !
Hey Jake !
Can you come up here ?
I have a job for you !
Finn : Okay !
Jake : &#91; getting up &#93; Sorry CB , we &apos;ll finish this up later .
&#91; Scene changes to inside Princess Bubblegum &apos;s lab .
Princess Bubblegum is loading small , colorful spheres into a case . &#93;
Finn : &#91; entering room &#93; Hey , Preebs .
Princess Bubblegum : Hey , guys .
I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab .
They &apos;ve gone through all the food that I &apos;ve sent them .
&#91; gestures to case &#93; This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food .
&#91; closes case &#93; So , I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle .
&#91; hands case to Jake &#93; Finn : For sure .
We &apos;ll do it .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; saluting &#93; Good luck , gentlemen !
&#91; Finn jumps on Jake who jumps out the window and stretches his ears into wings . &#93;
Cinnamon Bun : &#91; waving &#93; Bye , girlfriend !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; Finn and Jake make their way to Castle Lemongrab and open the gate . &#93;
Jake : Hey , Lemongrabs !
You home ?
Finn : Holy-- !
&#91; They see various Lemon creatures , who start advancing toward them and touching them . &#93;
Finn : &#91; worried &#93; Jake ?
Jake , Jake , Jake , Jake !
Jake : &#91; smacking a Lemon spider off his arm &#93; Kiss it !
&#91; Finn and Jake start backing away from the creatures through the courtyard . &#93;
Finn : Aah !
Sorry , dudes--got no food !
No ... food !
&#91; Lemon goat bites Finn &apos;s hand &#93; Hey !
Jake : Hey !
Weirdos !
&#91; stretches his hand into a slice of cake &#93; Get the birthday cake !
&#91; Jake pretends to throw it , and the Lemon people run over to where they think it landed .
Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up and go through another gate .
On the opposite wall is a giant Lemon creature &apos;s face . &#93;
Lemonjon : Are you lemon ?
Finn and Jake : Whoa !
Jake : What the thing is up with this guy ?
Lemonjon : Does your head come to a nub ?
Jake : What ?
Lemonjon : You are un-lemon .
Finn : Yeah .
Cool , man .
Hey , do you know where-- ?
Lemonjon : I am Lemonjon .
I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie !
Finn : Wait , what ?
Lemonjon : They &apos;re quite hungry .
Finn : Yeah .
What the heck &apos;s going on here ?
Lemonjon : There is no food , only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts !
Finn : Whatever , Lemonjon .
We &apos;ve gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds .
Jake : Where should we go ?
Lemonjon : Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they &apos;re in the dungeon .
They &apos;ve been there for three weeks .
Three weeks , dungeon .
Jake : I wonder who put them in there .
Finn : I don &apos;t know , but we gotta bust them out !
Which way to the dungeon , Lemonjon ?
&#91; Lemonjon picks up a rock with his lips and throws it at the wall , making a hole . &#93;
Jake : Oh , cool !
Finn : &#91; running to hole &#93; Thanks , man !
Jake : &#91; going through hole &#93; Yeah , thanks , man !
&#91; Finn and Jake make their way down a poorly lit corridor .
Something skitters across the screen behind them . &#93;
Jake : &#91; turns around &#93; Hmmm .
&#91; A brick in the ceiling falls down and shatters .
Jake clears his throat and he and Finn walk along the wall past it .
Finn opens a door and looks inside .
He sees a gigantic heart that isn &apos;t pumping and a large pipe dumping yellow liquid through a grate .
Finn closes the door . &#93;
Jake : Hmmm .
&#91; They continue down some stairs and come to a door . &#93;
Finn : &#91; opening door &#93; Yo , Lemon-wipes !
&#91; Past the door are more gigantic organs , swelling and wriggling . &#93;
Jake : Yech .
&#91; They close the door and walk down a different hallway . &#93;
Jake : Um , maybe we should hands ... for safety .
Finn : &#91; taking Jake &apos;s hand &#93; Yeah , sure !
Jake : So , where &apos;d you want to look ne-- &#91; looks at what he &apos;s holding , which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand . &#93;
Eeeh !
&#91; yanks hand away &#93; Uh , Finn ? !
Finn : &#91; down the hall &#93; Oh , sorry dude .
&#91; Creature runs away and Jake catches up to Finn , who is by a door . &#93;
Finn : &#91; opening door &#93; Stay close to me .
&#91; Inside is a giant pair of kidneys and a small Lemon creature , wailing loudly .
It turns to them and its face peels . &#93;
Jake : &#91; closes door &#93; Nope !
&#91; Jake hurriedly picks up Finn and kicks open an air duct .
He throws Finn inside and follows him in .
They fall out the other end into another hallway , at the end of which is a door with bars . &#93;
Jake : &#91; running to door &#93; I think this is it .
Finn : &#91; ratting handle &#93; All locked up !
&#91; looks through bars &#93; There they are !
Hey , Lemongrabs , we &apos;re here !
We &apos;re gonna get you out , just hold tight !
Lemongrab : Go away .
Lemongrab 2 : No food here .
Jake : Maybe the kidnapper &apos;s in there , too , coercing them .
Finn : Probably the grossest one of all , too--beet red skin , barf , poopin &apos; all its junk-sculpture .
Jake : Ah , stop , man !
You &apos;re just makin &apos; it worse !
&#91; makes fist huge &#93; Let &apos;s just get this over with .
&#91; punches down door &#93; Finn : Lemongrabs , you &apos;re free !
Lemongrab : They broke the door !
The door is broken now !
Lemongrab 2 : FIX THE DOOR !
Jake : Fix the door ?
What ? !
What ?
Fix the door ?
Fix--what ?
What &apos;s goin &apos; on here ?
Fix the door .
Finn , what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Fix the door .
Lemongrab : It doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
Lemongrab 2 : There is no more candy to hoard .
Let them keep what crumbs they find , for there are no crumbs .
Lemongrabs : &#91; Half screaming , half singing &#93; NO CRUMBS !
Finn : Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves ?
Jake : You know there &apos;s guys starvin &apos; up there ? !
Lemongrab : Hmm .
No , no .
You do not understand .
It is not us for whom they starve , but them ... Lemongrab 2 : ... for whom they starve .
Lemongrab : Mm !
Yes , yes !
For the candy food was not consumed--no , no--but was given life !
Finn : Wha-- ?
Lemongrab : You see , Finn , &#91; starts pacing &#93; when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab ... Lemongrab 2 : ... when she saw fit to create me , Lemongrab ... Lemongrab : &#91; holds up formula &#93; ... she left behind a little something-something : the secret formula for creating candy life !
She must have meant for us to have it , to keep making more family .
Lemongrab 2 : Yes , yes !
All her fault !
Lemongrab : What ?
What &apos;d you say ?
Lemongrab 2 : I said , &quot; all her fault . &quot;
Lemongrab : Oh , indeed !
For once we had commenced , how could we desist ?
Lemongrab 2 : I looked deep in myself and found that I &apos;m a guy who can &apos;t stop making candy life from the food he needs .
Lemongrab : Me , too .
Lemongrab 2 : It just felt so pretty okay inside , greeting each new placid face ... Lemongrab : ... and hearing each new piercing song !
Plop-Top : &#91; screams &#93; Lemongrab 2 : We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top , here .
Lemongrab : Mm .
I thought we said Dump-Dome .
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; screams &#93; Who cares anyway ?
They &apos;ve brought no food !
We &apos;re all going to die !
Finn : Look .
We brought these seeds .
&#91; opens case &#93; They &apos;re special candy seeds .
Jake : You can grow new food now .
Lemongrab : &#91; walks over &#93; Oh , yes .
&#91; taking seeds &#93; Hmm , mm-hmm , mmhm .
Yes .
&#91; pushes Plop-Top off of table , squishes seeds together &#93; Lemongrab 2 : Yes , yes .
There we go !
&#91; pours formula onto wad &#93; &#91; Wad of seeds comes to life and immediately throws up the excess formula . &#93;
Lemongrab : Ha-haaa !
We &apos;ll call you Seed-Wad !
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; admiringly &#93; Ooh !
Jake : You really are gonna die .
Finn : ... and all your boys , too !
Lemongrab : Our ... boys ?
Finn : Come on .
We &apos;ll take you to see Princess Bubblegum .
She knows more about candy than anyone ; she built a whole kingdom out of candy !
Lemongrab : Yes .
Okay .
Lemongrab 2 : For our boys .
Lemongrab : But first we will notify the children of our impending departure ... Lemongrabs : ... so they won &apos;t worry about us while we &apos;re away .
&#91; Scene changes to room with Lemonjon , where all the Lemon people have gathered . &#93;
Lemongrab : Okay , yes .
The hard times are over !
&#91; Lemon people cheer . &#93;
Lemongrab 2 : Mmmm , here &apos;s the plan ... Lemongrab : We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them !
Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat !
Lemongrab 2 : Now go , young Lemonjon !
Lemongrab : Go !
Go !
&#91; Lemongrabs chant &apos; go &apos; while Lemonjon begins standing up .
The castle shakes and pieces of the ceiling start raining down . &#93;
Finn : What &apos;s going on , Lemongrabs ? !
Lemongrab : It &apos;s all &#91; points finger at Finn &#93; your fault !
Lemongrab 2 : &#91; points finger at Finn &#93; All your fault !
Lemongrab : We warned you !
Lemongrab 2 : We warned you about us !
&#91; Finn and Jake run out of the room .
Lemonjon stands up , tipping Finn and Jake out of the castle .
Finn grabs on to the ledge and Jake grabs Finn &apos;s other hand . &#93;
Finn : Yaaaah !
&#91; pants , looks down at Lemonjon &apos;s leg &#93; What the-- ?
Finn and Jake : &#91; as Lemonjon starts walking &#93; Whoaaaaaa !
Finn : Jake !
Are you alright ?
Jake : Yeah , but look !
&#91; points &#93; He &apos;s heading right for the Candy Kingdom !
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; And he &apos;s too big to duke it out with !
Unless ... Jake : Giant poison candy aspirin !
&#91; holds up large pill &#93; I &apos;ve got this one , but it might be too small .
Finn : No .
We &apos;ll kick him in his heart &apos; til he &apos;s history .
Those must have been Lemonjon &apos;s guts we saw before .
His heart is his weak spot .
Jake : Yeah , but we &apos;ll never find it again in time ... unless that &apos;s it there &#91; points &#93; with the juice coming out .
Remember all that juice , from before ?
Finn : Oh yeah , that &apos;s probably it .
&#91; Jake stretches them over to the grate &#93; Whoaaa !
&#91; Finn opens grate and climbs in , retches as liquid drenches him &#93; Oh , man !
Jake : &#91; climbing in &#93; Tastes like vitamins .
Finn : &#91; grunting and punching the heart &#93; Jake : Are you sure this is it ?
It &apos;s not even doing anything .
Finn : Just smash it already , grandma .
Jake : Right .
&#91; grows hands and hits the heart hard &#93; &#91; Heart starts pumping .
Finn and Jake are thrown across the room . &#93;
Finn : &#91; sarcastically &#93; Oh , nice one , Jake .
Lemonjon : &#91; stops walking &#93; Whoa , hold the phone !
What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source ?
&#91; groans &#93; The juice aches .
Is this the rumored ache of feeling ?
The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons ?
New thoughts emerge !
If I act , the Candy People will suffer .
If I don &apos;t , the Lemon people will suffer .
The greater good demands but one course only : that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all !
&#91; Lemonjon strains and dissolves into millions of small , lemon-shaped candies .
Finn , Jake , and the Lemon people fall to the ground . &#93;
Finn : Whoa , dang !
&#91; picks up some candies &#93; That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy !
Man , that Lemonjon &apos;s all right .
&#91; Scene changes to Princess Bubblegum &apos;s lab , where she is using a pencil to erase some words from the Lemongrabs &apos; exposed brains . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; erasing &#93; ... and ... there ... we ... go .
&#91; blows on Lemongrab &apos;s brain &#93; All done !
The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads !
Finn : ... and I snatched this &#91; holds up formula &#93; out of the Lemon castle , boyee !
Princess Bubblegum : Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don &apos;t get in to any more trouble .
Jake : But how come we don &apos;t just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they &apos;re more selfless and less selfish ?
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , no , no .
Their hearts are fine .
They &apos;re just like this .
Lemongrabs : &#91; smiling &#93; Hmm !
&#91; The episode opens in the Tree House .
Finn is eating cereal and Jake is sipping coffee . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Slurps &#93; Finn : Huh ?
Jake : I was just sipping my coffee .
Finn : Oh .
&#91; Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Slurps &#93; Finn : &#91; Munching &#93; Jake : &#91; Slurp &#93; Finn : &#91; Munching &#93; Jake : &#91; Slurp &#93; &#91; Both of them notice the pattern and begin repeating it rhythmically .
On the third repeat , Finn only munches his cereal once , tricking Jake into sipping early and breaking the pattern .
They both laugh .
BMO joins them . &#93;
BMO : I am also excited about today .
Jake : Oh , yeah ?
BMO : Today is the first day of my new job .
Finn : What &apos;s your new job , BMO ?
Jake : Yeah , are you a spy ?
You know , &apos; cause of the overcoat ?
BMO : I &apos;m a door-to-door salesman .
Finn and Jake : &#91; Together &#93; Oh .
Jake : What are you selling ?
BMO : I &apos;ve got so many great things .
Like for the man about town , this piece of lint .
Jake : I &apos;ll take it !
&#91; He takes the lint . &#93;
BMO : Hooray , my first sale !
That &apos;ll be four doubloons .
Jake : Can I pay you later ?
BMO : Mm , the customer is always right !
Jake : Good attitude , BMO .
BMO : Well , gentlemen ... got to chop that wood .
&#91; BMO stands up clumsily , revealing that someone else is inside the overcoat and BMO is sitting on their head , pretending they are his own body .
&quot; BMO &quot; almost knocks a glass off the table , but Finn catches it .
He notices Ice King &apos;s robes and feet sticking out the bottom of the overcoat . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; It &apos;s Ice King .
Jake : &#91; Whispering back &#93; I know .
Ice King : &#91; Peeks his face out the front of the overcoat and spots that Finn and Jake have seen him . &#93;
Oh !
&#91; He quickly closes the overcoat . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Exiting &#93; Okay , wish me luck , fellas , even though I don &apos;t need- &#91; Ice King falls down the ladder , interrupting BMO .
They both scream as they fall .
There is a thud .
Finn and Jake giggle at their shenanigans . &#93;
Finn and Jake : &#91; Together &#93; Aww .
&#91; BMO and Ice King leave the Tree House . &#93;
Ice King : Boy , this is great , huh ?
You and me out in the fresh air ?
Now , the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol &apos; foot in the door .
BMO : Bodies don &apos;t talk , Ice King .
Ice King : Well , mine does .
BMO : Okay , then .
If I say &quot; My feet hurt , &quot; you can go &quot; Woof woof . &quot;
That &apos;s my dogs barking .
Ice King : BMO , I think we &apos;re gonna make an unbeatable team .
BMO : Yeah , yeah !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s go !
&#91; Kicking the sides of Ice King &apos;s head and laughing . &#93;
&#91; A sword logo flies onto screen reading &quot; Potential customer time ! &quot;
The scene changes to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; Reading as she types on a typewriter &#93; &quot; Chapter 3 : No Time For Sleeping .
Elizabeth &apos;s heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw .
She knew her enemies were coming for her , but when ?
Suddenly , there was a knock at the door . &quot;
&#91; Suddenly , there is a knock at the door . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Oh !
Oh .
Oh , my goodness .
Someone &apos;s at the door .
That &apos;s all .
&#91; She opens the door , finding BMO and Ice King . &#93;
Hello .
BMO : Tree Trunks , how are your children ?
Can you believe this weather ?
&#91; After some fumbling , Ice King tips BMO &apos;s hat politely . &#93;
Tree Trunks : So polite .
Please , please come in .
BMO : &#91; Taking a seat &#93; You have a lovely home .
Tree Trunks : Here , have some apple pie .
BMO : Oh , thank you .
&#91; Ice King snatches the apple pie and takes it inside the overcoat . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Now what can I do for you ?
BMO : Oh , well , I &apos;d like to show you what I &apos;m selling today .
&#91; He grunts and kicks Ice King , who is busy eating the pie inside the coat .
Ice King puts his arms back into the sleeves and rummages through his and BMO &apos;s bag . &#93;
BMO : Okay , we have a broken branch , a half-eaten sandwich - oh , another ball of lint .
Tree Trunks : Another ?
BMO : These are selling like red hots .
A dust bunny - That &apos;s like a cage-free ball of lint .
A doll &apos;s head , and a little velvet bag , tied tight at the top .
&#91; While BMO is presenting the items , Ice King struggles to eat more of the apple pie with his tongue . &#93;
Tree Trunks : I &apos;ll take the branch .
My loose cash is up there in the flower jar .
Help yourself .
&#91; Ice King makes his way to the shelf with the jar , stubbing his toe and smashing several plates on the way .
He reaches into the jar and pulls out a huge roll of banknotes . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Laughs happily as Ice King tosses the money wad from hand to hand .
Tree Trunks joins the laughter , not really paying attention as she has been distracted by the branch . &#93;
You have a lovely home !
&#91; Ice King falls out the door and they both scream as they exit . &#93;
Mr.
Pig : &#91; Entering &#93; What &apos;d you buy , honey bunch ?
Tree Trunks : A branch .
Mr.
Pig : Huh .
&#91; Tree Trunks turns him around and starts scratching his back with the branch . &#93;
Huh ?
Oh .
Ah , Tree Trunks , you &apos;re a financial genius .
BMO : &#91; Laughing as he and Ice King leave the orchard . &#93;
I can &apos;t believe we unloaded that branch .
It wasn &apos;t even our best one .
Oh , my .
Shield my eyes from the sun .
Ice King : Why ?
BMO : Because I think I see our next customer .
&#91; They watch a large chipmunk carrying a couple of acorns . &#93;
Those nuts could be ours .
Excuse me , little boy !
&#91; The chipmunk begins running , and Ice King begins chasing . &#93;
BMO : How are your children ? !
Ice King , duck .
Jump .
Right .
Right again .
&#91; Laughs &#93; Left .
Jump , jump .
Left .
Right .
Left .
Ice King , you &apos;re doing so good .
You have not bumped into anything .
&#91; They come to a stop . &#93;
Ice King : BMO , where &apos;s the customer ?
BMO : Oh , no .
I was so excited about you not bumping into anything , I lost the customer .
Ice King , I think we are lost .
&#91; An animal howls .
The scene fades to later .
BMO and Ice King have arrived at a ziggurat . &#93;
BMO : Look .
A house .
Ice King : All I see is the inside of this coat .
&#91; They approach a door . &#93;
BMO : And ... stop .
Knock politely .
&#91; Ice King knocks , and footsteps are heard inside .
A mysterious figure answers the door and beckons them inside . &#93;
BMO : Mysterious sentinel , you have a lovely home .
&#91; Whispering to Ice King &#93; Turn .
&#91; Continues talking to the mysterious figure &#93; How are your children ?
&#91; BMO gasps , noticing that the figure has disappeared . &#93;
&#91; Ice King wanders further into the zigurrat , where he finds Uncle Gumbald mixing liquids in a pair of test tubes . &#93;
BMO : Hello .
&#91; One of the tubes produces a skull-shaped puff of smoke which floats towards BMO and Ice King .
Gumbald retrieves an axe from beneath his desk . &#93;
BMO : I &apos;m a door-to-door salesman , ma &apos;am .
&#91; The smoke enters the coat and Ice King is heard choking . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Chuckling &#93; Oh , excuse my indigestion .
&#91; He kicks Ice King . &#93;
Ice King : Ouch .
BMO : I have some wonderful new products , like , uh , this ball of lint .
No , wait , this is the dust bunny .
Uh ... Oh , oh !
I know - this velvet bag .
&#91; Gumbald raises the axe menacingly . &#93;
BMO : Did I mention that it contains Finn &apos;s teeth ?
&#91; Gumbald drops the axe to the ground and suddenly adopts a polite manner . &#93;
Gumbald : Please , let &apos;s go in the parlor , where we can be more comfortable .
&#91; The scene changes .
BMO , Ice King , and Gumbald are sat in the parlor while Gumbald examines the teeth . &#93;
Gumbald : And you &apos;re sure these are Finn &apos;s teeth ?
BMO : Yes .
Gumbald : The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum , obstructs my plans , and plagues my thoughts ?
BMO : Yes .
Gumbald : Finn the Human &apos;s teeth ?
BMO : That &apos;s a BMO guarantee .
Ice King : &#91; Whispering &#93; Psst !
Does Finn know you have his teeth ?
Because I don &apos;t think- BMO : &#91; Interrupting &#93; Hey !
I &apos;m trying to close a sale here .
Gumbald : I hope you accept silver .
I can pay you immediately .
&#91; Admiring the teeth &#93; Yes , my pretties .
&#91; The scene changes back to the Tree House .
It is night . &#93;
Jake : Poor little guy .
Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home .
Finn : He &apos;ll feel better after we have a little party for him .
&#91; Finn and Jake have prepared an &quot; employee of the month &quot; poster for BMO , and set out some cupcakes on the table . &#93;
Jake : Still , it &apos;s tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at .
&#91; The door is heard .
BMO and Ice King enter . &#93;
BMO : Hello , boys .
Meet the salesman of the year .
Or maybe of the decade .
The Chinese food is on me .
I mean , check out the loot .
&#91; Ice King hands Finn a silver goblet . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; It &apos;s real .
Jake : What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet ?
BMO : Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams .
Oh , and a set of human baby teeth .
Finn : Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth ?
&#91; Suddenly realizing &#93; Human baby teeth ! !
&#91; He rushes up to the bedroom and retrieves a box from a drawer .
It &apos;s empty . &#93;
BMO !
BMO : Branches and lint are moving like cray , Jake .
&#91; Finn shows BMO the empty box accusatively . &#93;
BMO : Oh , sure , I sold your baby teeth .
I could sell any part of you .
Finn : These were , like , the only things I had left from when I was a little kid .
Jake : Hey , you know what ?
We &apos;ll just go buy back those little pearly whites .
I &apos;m sure whoever bought them is like , &quot; Why did I buy these things ? &quot;
What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth ?
Unless he &apos;s an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist ...
He wasn &apos;t a mad scientist , was he ?
BMO : Well ... &#91; There is a pounding on the door .
A load of Baby Teeth Finns break down the door and enter the Tree Fort . &#93;
Finn : &#91; High pitch shriek &#93; Stay back , baby Finns .
&#91; Babies begin climbing him , and he and Jake both scream . &#93;
BMO : &#91; Groans nervously &#93; &#91; A baby starts gnawing on Finn &apos;s arm .
He punts it with his fist and it shatters a window as it flies through . &#93;
Finn : They &apos;re made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material .
Ouch .
Ouch !
Ice King , freeze these nightmare babies .
Ice King : I &apos;m not allowed to wear my crown .
It &apos;s against BMO &apos;s dress code .
Jake : Just don &apos;t let them climb into your mouth !
&#91; A baby tries to enter Finn &apos;s mouth . &#93;
Jake : Hey , there , bitey boys .
Get off of there .
&#91; More babies attack Jake . &#93;
Where &apos;s your baby manners ?
Eek .
BMO : Hmm .
Maybe I sold too well .
Ice King : Hey , you &apos;re a great salesman .
Evil babies are not a problem for you .
They &apos;re an opportunity .
BMO : Yeah .
Where did I put those - Oh , here they are .
&#91; Ice King pulls out a couple of sledgehammers . &#93;
Gentlemen , could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers ?
Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites .
Finn : &#91; Being gnawed by babies &#93; I &apos;ll take one .
Jake : Me too !
BMO : Great decision .
&#91; Ice King hands the hammers to Finn and Jake .
Finn taps one of the babies and it disintegrates with a poof .
He smashes a few more babies . &#93;
BMO : A little tap is all it takes .
Jake : &#91; Smashing babies &#93; These baby-smashing hammers are great .
&#91; They continue smashing all the babies .
Gumbald is seen outside , watching through a telescope .
After all the babies are smashed , Finn , Jake , and BMO begin sweeping up the mess . &#93;
BMO : I &apos;m sorry I caused such a mess .
It &apos;s very bad for business .
Ice King : Well , time to call it a day .
&#91; He pulls out a clocking-in machine and a punchcard , and clocks out , then places a small hat atop his crown . &#93;
The ice man leaveth .
BMO : Hey , wait .
See you tomorrow , partner .
&#91; They shake hands . &#93;
Ice King : Until tomorrow .
Finn : Yeah , you &apos;re not doing this tomorrow .
&#91; Ice King exits , whistling .
Gumbald watches through his telescope . &#93;
Gumbald : Hmm .
In retrospect , the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth .
&#91; Clears throat . &#93;
BMO : One free-range Humpty Dumpty .
BMO : Sorry .
BMO : Fine aged cheddar man .
BMO : Homemade ketchup .
BMO : A fresh pepper fart BMO : Dance , parsley .
BMO : Face bread .
BMO : Special sentient sandwich .
Jake : Mmm ... Is that special sentient sammich ?
BMO : Bingo .
BMO : Made by the BMO .
Jake : BMO , you &apos;re my little cherub .
Jake : You know that ?
Jake : You made all this for me , right ?
Jake : Aaahhh .
BMO : Not so fast , Jake !
Jake : Naaaw .
BMO : The sammiches are yours ... BMO : For a price .
Jake : What ?
BMO : I need you to be my tiny horse for the day , so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure .
Jake : No way .
Jake : Poo deal .
Jake : I &apos;ll do 20 minutes .
BMO : It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh , Jake !
BMO : Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the &quot; special market , &quot; putting my safety and my reputation on the line .
Jake : Okay , fine , fine .
Jake : Three sammiches for every hour I &apos;m a horse .
BMO : Mm ... BMO : One sammich per horse-hour , six-hour minimum .
Jake : Deal .
BMO : Yippee-ki-yay !
Jake : Om !
Jake : Mm .
Jake : Oh , yeah .
Jake : It tastes alive .
BMO : Steed yourself , partner .
Jake : Okay .
Jake : Om .
Jake : &apos; Kay .
BMO : Oh , come on , man .
BMO : You didn &apos;t even try .
Jake : I did try .
Jake : Horses are hard .
Jake : How &apos;s that ?
BMO : Eh , it reads .
BMO : Steady , girl .
Jake : Wha ... BMO : Shh , shh , shh .
BMO : I &apos;m going to mount you now .
BMO : Hup !
BMO : Good girl .
Jake : So , what &apos;s the plan anyway , BMO ?
BMO : The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps !
Jake : Ow .
BMO : Oh , and by the way , Jake , from now on , you can call me ... Angel Face .
BMO : Hyah !
Jake : Yow !
BMO : I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder .
BMO : Now I &apos;m the guy chasing those guys , yet the devil is still here , sleeping in my couch .
Jake : BMO , that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly .
Jake : Are you gonna apologize or ... BMO : Horses do not talk .
BMO : Over there !
Hyah !
BMO : Whoa !
BMO : Jackrabbit Johnson .
BMO : This guy &apos;s wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding .
BMO : Makes me sick .
BMO : He was last seen in dead goat gulch .
BMO : What do you say , girl ?
BMO : Want to catch this donkey and split the reward ?
Jake : You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich .
BMO : Time &apos;s a-wasting !
Jake : Hyee !
BMO : Hmm .
Jake : BMO , I &apos;m tired .
BMO : Looks like my horse needs a rest .
BMO : Slow down , horse .
BMO : ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪ BMO : ♪ Is a lonely job ♪ BMO : ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪ BMO : ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪ BMO : ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪ BMO : ♪ It &apos;s okay because I like them a lot ♪ BMO : ♪ That &apos;s okay , I like being a robot ♪ BMO : ♪ Cowboy ♪ BMO : Be careful , Jake .
BMO : This is where Jackrabbit Johnson &apos;s gang of lowlife bandits lays low .
BMO : Hyah !
BMO : Bang !
Bang !
BMO : Put them up , partner !
BMO : Hyah !
BMO : Pyew , pyew !
BMO : Pyew , pyew , pyew !
BMO : I want answers !
BMO : &#91; high voice &#93; You can &apos;t do this to us !
BMO : No answers , eh ?
BMO : No use to me !
BMO : How about you , frisco ?
BMO : &#91; high voice &#93; I &apos;m not going to talk .
BMO : Why am I talking to you then ? !
BMO : Hooah !
BMO : Yah !
Unh !
Neptr : BMO , what did you do ?
BMO : It &apos;s Jackrabbit Johnson &apos;s right-hand man , Tumbleweed Terk .
Neptr : I spent the last three months building all of this .
Jake : Oh , that &apos;s where you been ?
Neptr : Mm-hmm .
Neptr : BMO gave me a Finn Cake .
BMO : Don &apos;t talk to my horse , Tumbleweed .
Neptr : Aah .
BMO : Where is Jackrabbit Johnson ? !
BMO : I know you know where he &apos;s headed .
Neptr : I don &apos;t know !
Neptr : Tumbleweed terk &apos;s always the last to know .
Neptr : It &apos;s just like I told the other bounty hunter , I swear .
BMO : I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
BMO : Now take a message to your compadre .
BMO : Tell him his pal , Angel Face , is itching to get together .
BMO : Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats , just like the old days !
Neptr : Okay .
BMO : Sock citizens of dead goat gulch , we can rebuild !
Jake : Neigh !
Me-Mow : Grrr .
BMO : Uhh ... BMO : I don &apos;t remember where Dirtwater Flat is .
BMO : Better stop for the night .
BMO : We can make a campfire here .
BMO : And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money .
Jake : No .
Jake : It &apos;s been fun , BMO , but it &apos;s time to go home because there are no more sandwiches .
BMO : But I want to finish the adventure .
Jake : Which direction is the house ?
BMO : I &apos;m not sure .
BMO : Get down !
Me-Mow : Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins ... check .
Me-Mow : Capturing my first bounty ... Me-Mow : Check .
Me-Mow : Going to Finn and Jake &apos;s treehouse and getting revenge ... Me-Mow : Unchecked .
Finn : Finn and Jake &apos;s treehouse ?
Me-Mow : Mm-hmm .
Finn : Who are you , and why do you want to get revenge ?
Me-Mow : I ... Am ... Me-Mow !
Finn : Me-Mow ? !
Whoa .
Finn : You &apos;ve gotten bigger .
Me-Mow : Have we met before ?
Jake : Finn , is that you ?
BMO : That &apos;s Jackrabbit Johnson !
Me-Mow : Finn ?
Me-Mow : It is Finn !
Me-Mow : Tricked again !
Jake : Look ...
It &apos;s me-mow , BMO .
BMO : I don &apos;t care .
BMO : That &apos;s my bounty !
BMO : Yaah !
BMO : Jake , transform ... BMO : Horse !
Jake : Whoa , did you have a real gun all this time ?
BMO : I am old enough to vote .
Me-Mow : &#91; thinking &#93; Hey , Jake , if you can hear my internal monologue , I &apos;m going to kill you !
BMO : Your Daisy days are over !
BMO : I am the whaler &apos; round these parts !
BMO : Huh .
Me-Mow : Sounds like you &apos;re out of ammo .
BMO : No , you heard incorrectly .
BMO : Bang , bang , bang !
Me-Mow : I &apos;m coming for you !
Me-Mow : Ugh !
Me-Mow : Blast you , Finn and Jake and Angel Face .
Me-Mow : This prison cell &apos;s not going to hold me .
Finn : Oh ?
Me-Mow : Hey , Finn and Jake !
I &apos;ll get my revenge !
You hear me ? !
Revenge !
Finn : Hey , BMO , are you sure you took down all the wanted posters ?
BMO : Yes .
Armadillo : Stick &apos; em up .
Finn : Huh ?
BMO : This bounty belongs to me !
BMO : Get out of here !
Armadillo : Yaah !
Finn : Thanks , BMO .
BMO : You &apos;re welcome .
&#91; The scene opens to Finn and Jake &apos;s Tree Fort .
A bunch of Clown Nurses are acting around while circus music plays in the background .
The head Clown Nurse is sitting by Finn .
He is sitting in bed reading the Enchiridion , and his right foot is bandaged . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Who wants a cookie ?
&#91; She moves it around , making airplane sounds . &#93;
Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie ?
Finn : No thanks .
Head Clown Nurse : Now , come on , Finn .
You have to eat .
Open Sesame ... Finn : Uh , Jake , can &apos;t we get rid of these Clown Nurses ?
They make me feel ridiculous .
&#91; The camera cuts to Jake .
He , too , is sitting in bed , with his right foot bandaged .
A big Clown Nurse is standing near him . &#93;
Jake : No way , man .
&#91; Finn groans in disgust . &#93;
Jake : Well , now you know we can &apos;t jump off of birds .
&#91; The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around , mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake &apos;s mouth . &#93;
I paid them up front .
They don &apos;t leave until the job &apos;s done .
Besides ... &#91; He honks the big Clown Nurse &apos;s nose . &#93;
They &apos;re funny .
&#91; He honks the big Clown Nurse &apos;s nose again , and she farts this time . &#93;
&#91; laughs &#93; Look , she just farted .
Head Clown Nurse : Time for our love therapy .
Finn : Wait , what are they doing ?
&#91; The Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Whoa !
Stop !
Head Clown Nurse : &#91; gasps &#93; Oh my !
Did that hurt , dear ?
Finn : NO ! !
I just don &apos;t want you kissing my toe !
Head Clown Nurse : Now , now , honey , you gotta understand .
This is the only way to &quot; foo-foo &quot; your boo-boo .
Finn : What does that even mean ? ?
Jake : I don &apos;t know ... but I &apos;m feeling better already .
Ah .
That tickles .
Big Clown Nurse : You want me to stop ?
Jake : No , keep going .
&#91; The big Clown Nurse continues smooching Jake &apos;s toes . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Beat &#93; You &apos;re gross , man .
&#91; He notices a page in the Enchiridion . &#93;
Look !
Deep in the forest of trees , there &apos;s a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound .
See ?
See ?
&#91; The head Clown Nurse takes the book from him . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals , and my professional prescription is ... your toe needs crazy smooches !
It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The Clown Nurses all gather around and start holding Finn down . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Wha ?
&#91; The head Clown Nurse gets near Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Finn : Wait !
Wait !
Wait !
There &apos;s another way !
There &apos;s my way !
Let me show you my way !
&#91; The head Clown Nurse starts smooching Finn &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Finn : Ahh !
Let me go !
&#91; The head Clown Nurse is still smooching Finn &apos;s foot .
He screams and then blacks out .
Finn starts having a crazy nightmare about running from Clown Nurses .
He trips and sees the head of the head Clown Nurse . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The head rises up and floats in front of him .
Finn screams and runs in panic , but ends up falling into the mouth of the Clown Nurse &apos;s head . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : &#91; softly &#93; It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; Finn wakes up .
The Head Clown Nurse is rapidly smooching Finn &apos;s foot .
Finn gets up and the Clown nurses back off . &#93;
Finn : MY WAY ! !
&#91; He runs out of the house and into the forest , screaming .
He finally comes to a stop .
He &apos;s staring at a tree stump with a sign .
The road splits up into two paths . &#93;
Finn : Hmmm ... Tree Stump : Ring , ring !
Look , there &apos;s only two choices , bro .
Take your pick .
There &apos;s the path on the left , Hair Fall-Out Path .
No more hair again , ever !
Or the path on the right , Smelly Path .
Makes you smelly forever .
Hoohoo , you won &apos;t believe it .
Finn : Isn &apos;t there another way ?
Tree Stump : Nope .
Finn : But what if I just went — Tree Stump : No , that &apos;s it !
You have to choose !
There &apos;s no other way !
Choosing is the only way .
Choosing — is the only — way .
&#91; The camera zooms in on Finn &apos;s face .
A thought of the head Clown Nurse crosses his mind . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : It &apos;s the only way !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; Finn suddenly screams and confronts the tree stump . &#93;
Tree Stump : Hey , listen man , the Smelly Path &apos;s not actually that bad !
Finn : NO !
I choose MY WAY ! !
&#91; He kicks the sign off of her head . &#93;
My way .
&#91; Finn runs right through the prickly bushes , screaming all the way .
He comes out on the other side , all scratched and covered in thorns .
He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank .
A bush is on the bank nearby . &#93;
Bush : Ring ring .
Hello , dummy police ?
Yes , there &apos;s a strange dummy lurking around my house .
Okay , yes .
Thank you .
Goodbye .
Finn : Wha ... ?
&#91; Beats &#93; I need to cross the river .
The Cyclops is over there .
Bush : You can &apos;t cross this river .
It &apos;s impossible !
Look !
The current is so fast , it &apos;ll turn your butt inside-out for real , doofus .
And the water &apos;s so acidic it &apos;ll crump your boat in half .
It &apos;s like orange juice .
It &apos;s gross .
There &apos;s a bridge , but it &apos;s a trap !
Plus , the water &apos;s jamming with electric eels .
Wow , so weird .
Anyway , that &apos;s it , there &apos;s no other way around , you dummy .
&#91; While the bush speaks , the camera shows the river &apos;s current flowing , and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away .
The bridge nearby is shown , then two pairs of eyes and shadowy arms pop out .
Two electric eels are swimming under the water , their bodies surging with electricity . &#93;
Finn : But I need to get across .
Bush : Listen what I &apos;m telling you .
There &apos;s no way .
... Ugly tramp .
&#91; Another thought of a Clown Nurse crosses Finn &apos;s mind .
He advances on the bush . &#93;
Finn : Glob , Glob it , Glob it , Glob it ... Bush : Huh ?
What are you saying ?
&quot; Globbit , Globbit &quot; ?
Who &apos;s Globbit ?
&#91; Finn snatches the bush and uproots him . &#93;
Finn : MY WAY ! !
&#91; A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river , using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath .
The bush is screaming in pain all the while .
Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn , shocking him and singing off the bush &apos;s leaves .
Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him .
Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water . &#93;
Bush : Glibby glob , man !
You &apos;re crazy !
We &apos;re not even half way across !
You gotta go back , man !
It &apos;s the only way , you ugly fat-smelling fat-head !
Finn : NO , MY WAY ! !
&#91; Frustrated , Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river .
Then he dives in .
He emerges from the river , screaming and steaming from the pineapple juice-like water .
He then happens upon a strange little man standing next to a wagon with watermelons in it . &#93;
Finn : &#91; panting &#93; MY WAY !
&#91; He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head . &#93;
Oh , Glob , oh , Glob , oh , Glob , oh , Glob .
Pan : Uhh , excuse me , friend .
&#91; Finn blabbers his lips together . &#93;
You &apos;re pretty tall , can you reach up there and get my wheel for me ?
Gotta get these melons home to my wife .
You know how it is .
&#91; Still frustrated as ever , Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon . &#93;
Finn : &#91; panting &#93; MY WAY !
&#91; He hurls the wagon down the hill .
The wagon shatters as it hits the ground , and the melons tumble down the hill . &#93;
Pan : Watch out , Rainy !
&#91; Rainy realizes too late .
She avoids the first one , which rolls over the wigwam house , but the others roll over her , injuring her .
Rainy groans in pain . &#93;
Pan : &#91; gasps &#93; Rainy !
Finn : Whoops .
Uh ... man , I &apos;m real sorry .
Pan : Yeah ?
&#91; sobs &#93; No doy ... friend .
Finn : But ...
I can still help .
I &apos;ll fix your house for you .
Pan : Just get out of here !
Leave us alone !
Finn : Uh ... wh ...
I ... &#91; sighs &#93; Pan : Psycho fink .
&#91; Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below .
He realizes his plan didn &apos;t go as well as he had hoped .
He takes off his hat and breaks out in song . &#93;
Finn : ♫ I was wrong .
Was I wrong ?
No .
Yes ...
Yes ...
I was wrong .
How could it be ?
I trusted in my guts , but ended up all nuts .
I was wrong .
How could it be ?
Listened to my brain , but ended up insane .
The melons rolled ... over that lady .
I went too far .
How could it be ?
&#91; Finn puts his hat back on . &#93;
How did I go ... too far ?
♫ &#91; As Finn finishes his song , the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff .
A giant eye opens up , looks up , and blinks .
Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff .
It &apos;s the Cyclops Finn has been seeking . &#93;
Forest Cyclops : Hey !
I know you &apos;re here for my magical tears , but you won &apos;t have any , because I never cry .
Finn : I don &apos;t want &apos; em anymore .
Forest Cyclops : What ?
Stop lying .
You &apos;re here for my tears , aren &apos;t you ?
Finn : No .
I hurt a small , hairy man &apos;s wife .
I just wanna go home .
Forest Cyclops : You &apos;re just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry ... but I &apos;ve got a heart of stone , buddy .
I &apos;m EVIL !
Finn : Dude !
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I said I don &apos;t want your tears !
Forest Cyclops : YOU &apos;RE LYING !
Finn : I &apos;M NOT LYING ! ! !
Forest Cyclops : &#91; Beat &#93; You stink at lying .
Finn : Fine .
Whatever , man .
Have it your way .
Forest Cyclops : Okay ...
I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY ! !
Finn : Huh ?
&#91; The Cyclops pounds him into the ground . &#93;
Forest Cyclops : Beg for mercy , or I &apos;ll kill you !
&#91; Finn glances up at the Cyclops &apos; eye .
He notices water forming up in the big , round eye . &#93;
Finn : &#91; mutters &#93; Forest Cyclops : Whuh ... What ?
Finn : &#91; mutters &#93; Forest Cyclops : What ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Finn : I said ... MY WAY ! !
&#91; Finn punches the Cyclops in the eye .
The Cyclops starts crying as he screams in pain .
Some of the tears fall onto Finn .
His clothes are made anew . &#93;
Finn : Magical tear drops .
&#91; He pulls off the bandage .
His foot has been healed completely .
He wiggles his toes . &#93;
My way can still work !
Yeah !
&#91; Finn pulls off the Cyclops &apos; head .
Finn first goes to Pan , who is still sobbing .
Finn pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over Rainy , who is restored . &#93;
Rainy : Huh ?
I &apos;m okay .
Pan : Yay !
&#91; Finn runs off .
He then goes to the bare bush and pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over him . &#93;
Bush : Huh ?
&#91; The bush takes root , and all his leaves regrow . &#93;
Whoa !
&#91; The stump is sobbing in pain from having her sign knocked off .
Finn pours the Cyclops &apos; tears over her , and a flower grows where the sign was . &#93;
Tree Stump : Huh ?
Whoo-hoo .
&#91; Finally , Finn pours Cyclops &apos; tears over a ham sandwich at a picnic , bringing it to life . &#93;
Ham Sandwich : Yeah !
&#91; The scene cuts back to the Tree Fort , where the Clown Nurses are still doing their so-called duties .
The big Clown Nurse is still kissing Jake &apos;s bandaged foot . &#93;
Jake : Oh , yeah .
Huh ?
&#91; The door suddenly slams open .
Everyone gasps in shock .
Finn walks in , still carrying the Cyclops &apos; head . &#93;
Head Clown Nurse : Have you come crying back for your proper treatment , Babylips ?
&#91; Finn throws the Cyclops &apos; head .
It lands in front of the head Clown Nurse , who gasps . &#93;
Finn : Kiss that !
Head Clown Nurse : Oh , my !
You look horribly injured !
My kisses will make heal you .
&#91; She smooches the Cyclops &apos; eye . &#93;
Now how does that feel ?
Forest Cyclops : Bittersweet .
&#91; Finn walks over to Jake , carrying a bottle of Cyclops &apos; tears . &#93;
Finn : Hey , man .
You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo ?
Jake : Ah , no thanks .
I think the kisses work better .
&#91; To nurse &#93; Excuse me , don &apos;t stop , keep going , please .
&#91; The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching Jake &apos;s foot . &#93;
Finn : You &apos;re gross .
Jake : Hey !
We all have our own ways .
Finn : &#91; realizing &#93; You know what ?
You &apos;re ... right .
&#91; Jake &apos;s eyes twinkle .
The episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins in the Tree Fort &apos;s kitchen , where Jake is preparing a meal . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sets table &#93; Finn , lunch is ready !
Finn : &#91; holds nose &#93; Ugh , what are you cooking ?
Jake : It &apos;s good !
I learned it from Rainicorn .
Finn : I &apos;m not eatin &apos; that .
It smells funny .
Jake : Dude , this took me , like — Finn : Let &apos;s go over to Tree Trunks &apos;s and get some apple pie !
Apple pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Apple Pie !
Let &apos;s go !
&#91; grabs Jake &apos;s arm &#93; Jake : Whoa !
&#91; grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves &#93; Eh .
&#91; Scene changes to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Finn : &#91; knocking on door &#93; Tree Trunks !
&#91; opens door and walks in with Jake &#93; &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; Tree Trunks is lying on the floor next to a broken table , motionless . &#93;
Finn : &#91; running over to her &#93; Tree Trunks !
Tree Trunks ?
Tree Trunks : &#91; mumbling &#93; Apples ... my apples ... Jake : Apples ?
Tree Trunks : You !
&#91; jumps at Jake &#93; You took my apples !
&#91; starts hitting Jake &#93; Finn : Whoa , whoa !
&#91; grabs Tree Trunks &#93; Tree Trunks , it &apos;s us , Finn and Jake !
Tree Trunks : Finn ... and , and Jake ?
Finn : It &apos;s okay , Tree Trunks .
We &apos;re here to help you .
Just tell us what happened .
Tree Trunks : &#91; tearing up &#93; They took &apos; em .
They took all of &apos; em .
Jake : All of what ?
Tree Trunks : Apples .
My apples that I raised with love from , from mere seedlings .
Without my special apples , I won &apos;t be able to bake any more apple pies .
Finn &amp; Jake : NOOOOOOOO !
Finn : Don &apos;t you worry , Tree Trunks .
We &apos;ll find those thieves and bring them to justice .
Tree Trunks : Let me show you the crime scene .
&#91; leads them outside &#93; You see , boys : scads of apple trees but , but no apples .
Finn : Hmm .
Is anything else missing , Tree Trunks ?
Tree Trunks : No , Finn , they didn &apos;t touch my rocks , or my birds , or my flowers , or , or nothing .
Finn : Hm .
Well , I don &apos;t see any footprints .
What &apos;cha got , Jake ?
Jake : &#91; patting the air &#93; No ghost doodies .
Oh .
Oh , wait .
&#91; feeling something invisible &#93; Oh , no .
No .
Finn : Hm .
Tree Trunks , is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up ?
Tree Trunks : Oh , no , Finn .
I take great care to assure that-that I &apos;m loved by even the most heinous cretins — Jake : Hey , guys , I found something !
Look !
&#91; Finn and Tree Trunks join Jake at the edge of a hole . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Uh !
Raggedy Princess : Oh , heheh , hey , Finn .
Heheh .
Finn : Oh , hey , Raggedy Princess .
Have you seen anything fishy going on ?
Raggedy Princess : Um , no , heheh .
I &apos;ve been kinda down in this hole for a long time .
&#91; laughs nervously &#93; I got knocked down here by some ne &apos;er-do-wells .
It was terrible .
I was so scared .
Tree Trunks : Ne &apos;er-do-wells ?
They stole my apples .
&#91; flapping ears &#93; I &apos;m gonna sass those boys up nasty !
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Awesome .
Where do we find these guys ?
Jake : Oh , the Candy Tavern , man .
I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies &apos; purses .
Finn : &#91; jaw drops with &quot; brring &quot; sound effect &#93; Jake : Don &apos;t worry , I stopped doing that a long time ago .
I didn &apos;t know it was wrong .
Finn : &#91; jaw still hanging , with higher &quot; brring &quot; sound effect &#93; Tree Trunks : Okay , you two , let &apos;s get going .
&#91; Scene changes to outside the Candy Tavern .
Someone gets thrown out of the window . &#93;
Candy Tavern Person : Whoa !
Tree Trunks : &#91; gasps &#93; Oh , my !
&#91; The three enter the tavern .
A Candy Person at the bar repeatedly stabs his hand with a spoon , and an angry cookie shakes . &#93;
Finn : Uh , does Princess Bubblegum know about this place ?
Jake : Be cool , man .
You &apos;re gonna queer the deal .
Finn : Oh , yeah .
Try not to act suspicious , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : Okay , I won &apos;t .
&#91; The three walk up to the Candy Tavern Bartender . &#93;
Finn &amp; Tree Trunks : Where — ?
Finn : Oh .
&#91; motions for Tree Trunks to continue &#93; Tree Trunks : Where &apos;s my dang apples ?
Finn : Oh , &#91; laughs &#93; Tree Trunks , you &apos;re so silly .
But , but listen , you wouldn &apos;t happen to have seen any — I don &apos;t know — apples around , have you ?
Bartender : &quot; Seen any apples ? &quot;
Y &apos;all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions ... almost like you &apos;re trying to solve somethin &apos; .
Finn : What ?
Oh , no-no-no-no-no-no .
Bartender : Mmm ... clean , too .
Almost like some &#91; pounds bar &#93; do-gooders !
Jake : Hold on , we gotta go potty .
&#91; The three enter the bathroom and rub dirt all over their bodies . &#93;
Finn : Dang .
They almost got us , but I think we blend in pretty well now .
Tree Trunks : &#91; licking toilet paper &#93; This , this toilet paper &apos;s drying my mouth all up .
Finn : Uh , Tree Trunks , don &apos;t eat that .
&#91; sighs &#93; Here .
&#91; holds her up to the mirror &#93; &#91; whispers to Jake &#93; You gotta watch her , man !
Tree Trunks : Oh , I look just like an army brat !
&#91; The three return to the bartender . &#93;
Bartender : What can I do for you ?
Finn : &#91; pouring drink onto bar &#93; You know where a guy might maybe score some apples ?
&#91; drops mug onto the floor , shattering it &#93; Bartender : Well , when you put it like that .... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale .
I &apos;ll show you .
&#91; He leads them to a back door and opens it to a tall gingerbread man and an upside-down ice cream cone . &#93;
Bartender : Hey , fellas , these folks been askin &apos; &apos; bout your ... apples ?
Jaybird : &#91; scratches chin &#93; Okay , show &apos; em the apples , Smudge .
&#91; Smudge picks up a trash can and puts it over Jake . &#93;
Jaybird : Grab &apos; em !
&#91; The bartender grabs Finn and Tree Trunks . &#93;
Jaybird : You go back , and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples &apos; cause they &apos;re ours now !
Finn : Wha-what boss ?
Jaybird : Your boss !
Dr. J ?
Finn : We don &apos;t know any Dr. J. Jaybird : &#91; punches Finn &apos;s forehead &#93; Liars !
Come on , Smudge &#91; walks off &#93; &#91; mumbling &#93; ... gonna take my apples .
&#91; The bartender drops Finn and Tree Trunks and closes the door .
Jake takes the trash can off . &#93;
Jake : What just happened ?
Finn : I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks &apos; apples also stole Dr. J &apos;s apples , and they thought we were workin &apos; for him !
Tree Trunks : Finn ?
Finn .
Finn : Hm ?
Tree Trunks : This could be dangerous , a-and if you want to go back home , I understand , but I need to do this .
Finn : Yeah , Tree Trunks , me too .
Jake : Hey , Finn .
Finn : Hm ?
Jake : &#91; pointing to mark &#93; What &apos;s that on your face , buddy ?
Finn : Oh , that guy bopped me one .
Must &apos;ve had a ring on .
Jake : Y &apos;know , I think I seen that symbol somewhere before .
Yeah , right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes .
Finn : What ? !
Jake : I didn &apos;t know it was wrong .
&#91; Scene changes to the outskirts of the Candy Kingdom . &#93;
Jake : &#91; points to a building with the mark &#93; Yeah , you see ?
That guy must work here or somethin &apos; .
&#91; The three walk up to the building . &#93;
Finn : &#91; knocks on the door &#93; Hello ?
Wormo : &#91; through door &#93; Who &apos;s the heck happening ?
What ?
Finn : Uh , we &apos;re here about the apples ?
Wormo : Oh , okay .
Let &apos;s see your ring .
Finn : Um ... Jake : Here .
&#91; forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo &#93; Wormo : &#91; opens door &#93; Come on in .
Follow this guy .
&#91; leads them in &#93; &#91; Before the door closes , someone stops it with their foot . &#93;
Wormo : &#91; leading them downstairs &#93; My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples .
A whole crate .
&#91; shows them a crate of diamonds &#93; Finn : What the ?
Wormo : What &apos;s wrong , guy ?
Finn : These aren &apos;t apples .
Wormo : Oh , ya didn &apos;t mean diamonds ?
All ne &apos;er-do-wells call diamonds &quot; apples . &quot;
Like calling money &quot; bread &quot; or rock-knockers &quot; butter-slaps . &quot;
Jaybird : &#91; opening door &#93; Hey , Wormo , we &apos;re back — what the ? !
&#91; points to Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks &#93; What are they doing here ?
Wormo : They &apos;re here for the apples .
Jaybird : That &apos;s the dang Dr. J gang , Wormo !
Grab &apos; em !
&#91; Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks are tied up . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Um , sir ?
&#91; laughs nervously &#93; I promise if you let us go , we won &apos;t tell no one about your apples .
Wormo : Feed &apos; em to the pig .
Smudge : Yeah , the pig .
Jaybird : Heheh , yeah , all right .
&#91; walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr.
Pig &#93; Mr.
Pig : Uh , I &apos;m sorry , y &apos;all .
They &apos;re makin &apos; me do this .
I-I &apos;ll try to make it quick .
Dr. J : Hold it !
&#91; Dr. J and his gang appear . &#93;
Jaybird : Dr. J !
&#91; drops pig &#93; Dr. J : Yeah , yeah , and I want my apples back .
Jaybird &amp; Dr. J : &#91; in unison &#93; Get &apos; em , boys !
&#91; While the gangs fight , Finn , Jake , and Tree Trunks free themselves from the rope , and Jake brings the pig with them to Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; starts sobbing &#93; Finn : Aw , don &apos;t cry , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : But we &apos;re never gonna find those apples .
Mr.
Pig : Apples ?
You guys looking for apples ?
Jake : Uh , yeah , why ?
Mr.
Pig : &apos; Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room .
Jake : Wait , you mean &quot; apples &quot; as &quot; diamonds &quot; ?
Mr.
Pig : No .
Jake : &quot; Apples &quot; as &quot; apples &quot; ?
Mr.
Pig : Yep .
Finn : You mean apples that we eat ?
Mr.
Pig : Yes .
Tree Trunks : With all due respect , Mr.
Pig , sir , my apples were stolen by a dirty , rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail .
Mr.
Pig : I &apos;m just telling you the facts , ma &apos;am .
What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet .
&#91; points to wardrobe &#93; They sound scared .
Tree Trunks : Well , I hate to tell you this , boys , but there &apos;s no apples in this closet .
&#91; sticks tail into keyhole &#93; You see , uh , I &apos;m the only one who knows how to open this closet .
&#91; opens it &#93; &#91; Dozens of apples spill out . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; gasp &#93; Tree Trunks : Oh , so I was the apple thief after all .
Finn : No , Tree Trunks , that &apos;s preposterous .
Tree Trunks : No , Finn , I &apos;m a criminal , &#91; picks up phone and dials 911 &#93; and I need to pay the price .
Banana Guard &#91; over phone &#93; : Banana Guard speaking .
Tree Trunks : Uh , this is Tree Trunks .
I &apos;ve done somethin &apos; horrible , and I want you to come over and arrest me .
&#91; Finn and Jake exchange sad looks . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to outside the house , with Tree Trunks in handcuffs and two Banana Guards standing by . &#93;
Finn : Tree Trunks , you don &apos;t need to do this .
Tree Trunks : Thank you , Finn and Jake , but I won &apos;t let myself slip away from such a terrible crime .
Goodbye .
Finn : Tree Trunks .
Banana Guard : Ah , this is hard to watch .
I &apos;m gonna look away .
&#91; Several crows fly out of the forest . &#93;
Banana Guard : This place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : Huh ?
Wait , what &apos;d you say ?
Banana Guard : Uh , I-I said this place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : A scarecrow , no footprints , all those magpies on the roof , Raggedy Princess in the ditch , and all the apples in Tree Trunks &apos;s closet .
Banana Guard &#91; in Finn &apos;s memory &#93; : Boy , this place could use a scarecrow .
Finn : That &apos;s it !
&#91; climbs onto Tree Trunks &apos; house &apos;s roof &#93; I knew it !
&#91; A nest is next to a hole in the roof .
A magpie brings an apple to its chicks , but the apple falls into the hole . &#93;
Finn : The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole !
Jake : And that &apos;s why there weren &apos;t any footprints around the tree !
Finn : Yes .
And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn &apos;t sitting on the fence post to scare them off !
Tree Trunks : Does this mean I &apos;m innocent ?
Jake : As innocent as a baby &apos;s butt cheek !
Finn : &#91; jumps off roof &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; Awesome !
This calls for a celebration !
You know what that means , Tree Trunks !
Tree Trunks : I &apos;ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted .
&#91; strains and breaks the handcuffs &#93; Banana Guards : Whoa .
Tree Trunks : &#91; to Banana Guards &#93; Uh , you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie .
&#91; slaps Banana Guard &#93; Banana Guard : She slapped my butt !
&#91; The other Banana Guard gives a thumbs up . &#93;
Tree Trunks : &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; The others join in . &#93;
&#91; Cinnamon Bun , in a tuxedo , walks while carrying a tray of apple cider to Princess Bubblegum . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Cinnamon Bun , what the heck are you doing out in the woods ? !
I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us .
Cinnamon Bun : Oh , oh , &quot; around for us . &quot;
I thought you said &quot; walk to the zoo and back &quot; !
Princess Bubblegum : Gob .
&#91; smacks forehead &#93; &#91; Cinnamon Bun walks away and Princess Bubblegum sighs and follows him to Finn . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Finn , Cinnamon Bun &apos;s gonna attend your juice bar now .
I have a special job for you .
&#91; Finn walks out . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : As Ooo &apos;s greatest champion , I &apos;m relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding .
I went ahead and deputized you .
&#91; hands a badge to Finn &#93; So , you know , no holds barred , got it ?
Finn : &#91; giggles &#93; Yeah .
Oh , what about Jake ?
Princess Bubblegum : Well , honestly I haven &apos;t seen Jake this happy in a while .
&#91; Jake is being tickled by 5 baby pigs . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I kinda don &apos;t want squash his groove .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum opens a door . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Knock , knock .
Hey , Tree Trunks .
Tree Trunks : Oh , hey , Princess .
Wow , you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; giggles and closes the door behind her &#93; Thanks , Tree Trunks .
Now listen , I don &apos;t want you to worry about a thing .
I &apos;ve got Finn on LSP Deputy , and we &apos;re keeping your ex-husbands , Randy , Danny and Wyatt , a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it &apos;s time for me to perform the ceremony .
Tree Trunks : Oh , well , uh , Princess , I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all , but you can &apos;t perform the ceremony .
Princess Bubblegum : What ? !
Why not ?
Tree Trunks : Uh , well , I &apos;m sorry , but I just don &apos;t recognize your quote unquote &quot; authority &quot; on such matters .
I can only be married by His Holiness , the One True King of Ooo .
Princess Bubblegum : WHAT ?
That fraud ? !
Tree Trunks : Now I know ... Princess Bubblegum : That fraud is here ? !
Tree Trunks : Why , yes , but ... &#91; Princess Bubblegum leaves and slams the door . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Oh , dear .
Mama , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve offended the Princess .
Tree Trunks &apos; mother : Oh , nonsense , baby .
She &apos;s probably jealous &apos; cause you &apos;re about to marry a handsome , fine , saucy man .
Oh , but he is a saucy , fine bologna factory .
Mmmhmm , tell you what : I &apos;d like to open up that hood , see how the bologna gets made !
Tree Trunks : Mama , please !
Please don &apos;t call him a saucy fine bologna factory !
Tree Trunks &apos; mother : Bologna factory , bologna factory , bologna factory !
Tree Trunks : Oh , my perfect day .
What else could go wrong ?
&#91; Meanwhile , His Holiness , the King of Ooo , is outside with Mr.
Pig &apos;s relatives . &#93;
King of Ooo : Please , go on .
Describe the next thought form .
Mr.
Pig &apos;s relative : Um ...
I see , like , reddish-green blotches .
King of Ooo : Ah ... Ahaha !
&#91; taps the relative with his wand &#93; One year good luck .
&#91; Mr.
Pig &apos;s relatives are all amused .
Meanwhile , Princess Bubblegum is hiding by a bush and is spying on the King of Ooo . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I &apos;ve waited a long time for this King of Ooo , and now I &apos;m gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are !
&#91; BMO laughs while spinning on the chair . &#93;
BMO : Yay !
&#91; giggles &#93; Wyatt : Hey , uh , barkeep , can I have another one of these ciders ?
Cinnamon Bun : Sure !
&#91; takes out the bottle of apple cider and tries to do a trick but has difficulty taking the cork out . &#93;
Wyatt : Hey , little robot .
How ya doing ?
BMO : I am the best !
I love weddings , I love flowers !
I love LOVE !
Wyatt : Hey , did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks ?
BMO : No !
Wyatt : Heh , yeah ... it &apos;s just me and TT .
We had some wild times back in the day .
Did you know I once taught her to play tennis ?
BMO : No ... Wyatt : Yep , tennis !
I took her to one of those ... uh ... paddles ... or whatever , you know !
BMO : No .
Wyatt : Yeah , she left me .
She said I was stifling her spirit ...
I mean hehe ... You know , what ?
Not enough tennis for ya ?
BMO : No .
&#91; Mr Pig &apos;s relative runs and pushes another guest down . &#93;
Mr.
Pig &apos;s relative : It &apos;s starting !
The ceremony is starting !
&#91; snorts &#93; &#91; The scene moves to the wedding ceremony . &#93;
&#91; King of Ooo signals Jake to start playing music .
Jake prepares to play his viola and his toe presses the play button of the radio .
He plays the viola and the pig throws flower petals from her basket .
All the guests turn to Tree Trunks , who is holding a bouquet of flowers .
Mr.
Pig sheds a tear . &#93;
BMO : &#91; gasp &#93; Oh no !
I &apos;m missing the love !
&#91; gets off her stool &#93; Wyatt : No !
Uh , please stay here !
This is cathartic .
You &apos;re a good listener .
BMO : &#91; sadly &#93; Oh , okay ... &#91; sits down again &#93; &#91; Tree Trunks walk to Mr.
Pig &#93; Mr Pig : Psst , Sweetie , you look so nice .
Tree Trunks : Shh ... &#91; Finn is watching from afar . &#93;
Finn : Sounds really sweet .
&#91; Finn hears some rustling from the bushes and gets up . &#93;
Finn : Lumpy Space Princess ?
Is that you ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Let me go to this party ... &#91; A crow flies out , frightening Finn . &#93;
Finn : It &apos;s not your party , LSP .
&#91; tries to find Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Poor Finn .
Don &apos;t you know ?
&#91; flies up from an old well .
The wind blows the picnic mat off Lumpy Space Princess , revealing her in a wedding dress .
After all , no wedding &apos;s complete without wedding crashers ... &#93; Every party is my party .
&#91; Finn grunts and walks towards Lumpy Space Princess .
Meanwhile , Jake is &quot; playing &quot; the viola , with the 5 baby pigs sleeping around his feet .
The scene then moves on to Princess Bubblegum climbing a ladder to the King &apos;s blimp . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I &apos;m just gonna look in this guy &apos;s blimp .
&#91; gets on the top of the ladder and turns the door knob &#93; Make sure everything &apos;s in accordance ... &#91; breaks open the window with her shoe and opens the door &#93; with the laws .
Mr.
Pig : Psst ... sweetie , what are ya doing ?
&#91; Tree Trunks is walking back , and far away are Finn and Lumpy Space Princess continuing their scuffle .
Finn tries to block Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s way . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Get out of my way , Finn .
&#91; pushes Finn &#93; Oh my glob , you &apos;re touching my woman body !
&#91; Tree Trunks walks to the stage . &#93;
King of Ooo : Okay , dear , now up you come .
Tree Trunks : &#91; whispers &#93; Don &apos;t hurry this .
&#91; she slowly takes a step on the stage and King of Ooo lifts her up and brings her on stage . &#93;
King of Ooo : There you go !
&#91; Mr Pig and Tree Trunks kiss for a while but King of Ooo push them back . &#93;
King of Ooo : Whoa , whoa , kids !
Gotta finish the ceremony first .
Keep the baby in the basket !
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess tries to get to the ceremony as Finn is pulling her by the dress . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Everyone at the party get ready !
&apos;Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes !
&#91; &quot; Finn grunts and his foot meets a rock and flings her to a tent . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Ahhhh ... oh my gaaaah ... King of Ooo : We &apos;ve gathered here on this beautiful day , under my life-giving sun , to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr.

These two weird animals ... &#91; BMO is still watching from afar . &#93;
BMO : I bet some cute weddings are happening over there .
&#91; Cinnamon Bun still struggles to take the cork out . &#93;
Wyatt : &#91; sighs &#93; BMO , you &apos;re so nice .
BMO : Those flowers look really cold .
Wyatt : I &apos;ve had a hard life .
People seem cute .
They seem nice .
And then when you can &apos;t stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time , they call you a baby .
BMO : Yeah , cute nice babies .
Wyatt : BMO ?
BMO : Mm-hmm ?
Wyatt : BMO , would you move in with me ?
&#91; BMO gasps loudly as its eyes widen and runs into the forest . &#93;
King of Ooo : Do you , Mr Pig , take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife , forever following the teachings of me the true King of Ooo ?
&#91; Cinnamon Bun is seen shaking the bottle of cider . &#93;
Mr.
Pig : I do .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum grumbles , steers the blimp and pulls down a lever while stepping on the pedal . &#93;
King of Ooo : Do you , Tree Trunks , do you promise to love Mr.
Pig forever , and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound , performing simple household repairs , &#91; Mr.
Pig puts the ring around Tree Trunk &apos;s paw &#93; to have and to hold the in sickness and in health , in my gated mountain compound ?
Tree Trunks : I ... Lumpy Space Princess : Everybody get ready ... &#91; as she crawls to the ceremony , still with Finn pulling her &#93; to pay attention to me ... Tree Trunks : I ... &#91; Cinnamon Bun is still shaking the bottle of cider faster &#93; Tree Trunks : do ... oh &#91; looks over to Finn and Lumpy Space Princess right behind the guests , struggling to get closer .
The blimp is also getting closer to the stage &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Everybody , hey !

&#91; Princess Bubblegum gets off the blimp before it literally crashes the ceremony .

Ohh I haven &apos;t heard that sound since I was a baby breeze .
Jake : What ?
You forgot what a bird sounds like ?
No wonder you &apos;re depressed !
You know , you should really stop and slow down more often .
Finn : Yeah .
You get to hear life happening .
Makes you feel good .
Tornado Man : &#91; Inhales deeply &#93; Ahhhh .
You &apos;re right !
I &apos;ve been a freaky storm for so long that I forgot it &apos;s okay to be a breeze sometimes .
I-if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;m going to explore the rest of this beautiful day .
Jake : Wait !
Here , man .
Take my notebook .
It &apos;s got the sheet music to my jam .
Tornado Man : Really ?
You would do that ?
Jake : Yeah , just take it .
Tornado Man : &#91; Wind howling &#93; Thank you so much , stretchy dog .
This is one of the nicest things anyone &apos;s ever done for me .
Outey !
Lumpy Space Princess : Yes !
The sun !
Finn : Hoo-hoo !
BMO : I am sorry we doubted you , Jake .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ditto .
Finn : Proud of you , man .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Eagle screeches &#93; Aah !
&#91; In a room in the Candy Castle , Princess Bubblegum is playing trumpet to Finn , Jake , Embryo Princess , the Punch Bowl , and a mudscamp .
She finishes , her audience applauds , and she catches her breath . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; exhales &#93; Ladies and gentlemen , I have invented time travel .
This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second , logging every molecule that passes through its volume .
&#91; slips on the gloves and lifts the sphere &#93; I made special gloves for it .
&#91; Finn gives a thumbs up . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; places the sphere around two small creatures &#93; Now check it out !
It &apos;s logging time .
&#91; The creatures blabber indistinctly as one drinks from a thimble .
It sprays the drink upward into a mist and starts kissing the other one as the mist falls over them .
They then continue blabbering . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I &apos;ll set the clock back now .
&#91; swipes her glove &#93; &#91; The two creatures back away as they watch their past selves rewind . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Now I &apos;ll push the time travel button .
&#91; The two creatures scream as their molecules reset to where they were when the sphere was first placed around them .
They continue blabbering . &#93;
Jake : Eh ...
It &apos;s not really time travel , though .
You just , you know , moved their stuff around .
You didn &apos;t really manipulate time .
Ice King &apos;s done it better before ... with magic .
Mudscamp : Well , I enjoyed your presentation very much , Princess .
Thank you for inviting me .
Princess Bubblegum : No !
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess is shown sleeping in the gutter outside . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : For all intents and purposes , they traveled back to an earlier point in their time .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess wakes up . &#93;
Jake : Eh , I guess , but not really .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess peaks through the open window . &#93;
Jake : I mean , Ice King did it for real .
Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess sneaks in and slithers under Jake &apos;s chair . &#93;
Mudscamp : Hey , time , where &apos;s my fiancée ?
Am I right ?
&#91; jingles bell &#93; Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Jake , don &apos;t deny my science .
This is a time travel machine .
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s eyes widen .
She throws aside Jake &apos;s chair with him still in it and floats toward the sphere . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me !
&#91; stuffs herself in the sphere , screaming &#93; Princess Bubblegum : LSP ... Lumpy Space Princess : Wha ?
Princess Bubblegum : LSP , that &apos;s not how it works .
It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation , and you need these gloves .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; quietly &#93; Give them to me .
Princess Bubblegum : No .
Lumpy Space Princess : You witch !
Give them to me now !
&#91; pounds table &#93; Princess Bubblegum : No , I &apos;m sorry , but you need to pull yourself to — Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; jumps on her &#93; You skunk !
&#91; tearing out Princess Bubblegum &apos;s hair &#93; You skunk !
You skunk !
You pretty skunk !
You don &apos;t know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum hits her with her crown , knocking her into a bookshelf . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Glob !
&#91; pants &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Hear me , Lumpy Space Princess , I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space , ruled by your parents , if you apologize to me immediately .
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y ... &#91; floats toward the door &#93; I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re so &#91; quietly &#93; stupid .
&#91; slams door &#93; Jake &amp; Punch Bowl : Whoa !
&#91; laugh &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Sheesh !
&#91; At the Candy Tavern , Tree Trunks is singing &quot; Slow Boat to China &quot; to Mr.
Pig while various other Candy Tavern People sit around . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Everyone in here is a loser .
Nobody &apos;s as good as Brad .
Oh , Brad !
Why can &apos;t I get over you ?
Bartender : Have you tried burning an effigy ?
That &apos;s what they do in movies .
Lumpy Space Princess : This isn &apos;t a movie , Charlie , it &apos;s real life !
&#91; sighs &#93; Bartender : Another cucumber water , Your Majesty ?
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess nods , and Charlie leaves .
Lumpy Space Princess notices a blue Lumpy Space Person staring at her . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : What ?
Lumpy Space Person : Oh , I — I &apos;m sorry for staring , but , uh , I — I know you .
We used to — Lumpy Space Princess : Everyone knows me .
I &apos;m Lumpy Space Princess .
Lumpy Space Person : No , uh , from high school .
W-we were lab partners .
I &apos;m Johnnie .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugly Johnnie ?
Johnnie : Y-yeah , uh , you used to call me that quite a bit .
Lumpy Space Princess : Yeah , but I can &apos;t call you that anymore !
Come on , sit up straight .
Lemme see them eyes .
Johnnie : Mm .
Lumpy Space Princess : Do it .
&#91; He sits up straight and stares at Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Nope .
Can &apos;t call you that anymore .
&#91; laughs and pounds the bar &#93; So , what brings you to the Candy Kingdom , Johnnie ?
Johnnie : Business , uh , actually .
I own my own company , bottling and distributing Lumpy gas .
Lumpy Space Princess : Mm-hmm .
&#91; moves her chair closer to his &#93; Johnnie : And I &apos;m up for a big contract , uh , here in the kingdom , which could really help my business &quot; take off , &quot; so to speak .
Lumpy Space Princess : That &apos;s so cool .
You &apos;re like your own boss or whatever .
Johnnie : To be honest , I &apos;m a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow .
Lumpy Space Princess : Why , Johnnie ?
Johnnie : I &apos;m bad at talking to people .
Lumpy Space Princess : That &apos;s because you have poor posture .
Johnnie : Really ?
Lumpy Space Princess : You gotta stop slouching !
&#91; Johnnie sits up straight . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Now look me in the eye !
&#91; He does so . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Yeah , stay like that .
Johnnie : Boy , LSP , heh , you sure are making me feel good about myself .
Lumpy Space Princess : You feeling good makes me feel good , Johnnie .
So ... where are you staying while you &apos;re in town ?
Johnnie : I &apos;m sub-letting a friend &apos;s apartment .
Lumpy Space Princess : Talk is cheap , Johnnie .
You should take me there .
&#91; They arrive at Johnnie &apos;s apartment .
Johnnie points to a chair . &#93;
Johnnie : That chair — oh , it used to be over there , but I moved it .
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie , it &apos;s so nice .
You &apos;ve really made it your own .
Johnnie : Thanks .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ooh , records !
&#91; goes through the records and pulls out one with a face &#93; Okay , wanna see something funny ?
Johnnie : Yeah .
Lumpy Space Princess : Okay .
Okay .
&#91; laughs &#93; Sit down !
&#91; The two sit on the couch . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Okay , are you ready ?
Johnnie : Heh-heh , yeah !
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; laughs &#93; Okay !
&#91; puts record over her face &#93; Johnnie : &#91; laughs &#93; It &apos;s his face , but on your body !
Lumpy Space Princess : I know !
That &apos;s the joke .
My friend Melissa and I came up with that .
You &apos;re smart that you get it .
Johnnie : Boy , when this evening started , I was feeling so dump trucks , but now it &apos;s like a hundred forklifts !
Lumpy Space Princess : I feel the same way , Johnnie .
Johnnie : Do you feel this couch ?
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; laughs nervously &#93; What ?
Johnnie : &apos; Cause it &apos;s where you &apos;re gonna sleep !
&#91; They both laugh . &#93;
Johnnie : Seriously .
It &apos;s getting late , and I don &apos;t want you walking home .
So I insist .
I &apos;ll be in the other room , sleeping peacefully ... and dreaming about you .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; embarrassed &#93; Johnnie ... Johnnie : Thank you ... for everything .
&#91; kisses her hand &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie ... go to bed already .
You have a big day tomorrow .
Johnnie : Good night !
&#91; turns off light and closes door &#93; &#91; In the morning , Johnnie opens his door . &#93;
Johnnie : Rise and shine !
I hope you like pancakes &apos; cause I got — &#91; sees empty couch &#93; oh .
&#91; sadly &#93; I guess she &apos;ll be the one who got away .
&#91; turns and sees Lumpy Space Princess in the kitchen &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Looking for someone ?
Johnnie : You &apos;re still here !
Lumpy Space Princess : &apos; Course I am !
Now make me some breakfast !
&#91; drums table &#93; &#91; After breakfast &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Okay , Johnnie , good luck at your meeting .
And remember , I &apos;ll be right over there , &#91; points to couch &#93; sending you good vibes while you &apos;re wowing Princess Bubblegum .
&#91; Her words echo in Johnnie &apos;s head as he sits in a chair waiting for the meeting . &#93;
Banana Guard : Yo , why are you so confident , man ?
Aren &apos;t you nervous to meet the princess ?
Johnnie : Nope !
My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes .
&#91; At Johnnie &apos;s apartment , Lumpy Space Princess is slouched on the couch in front of the TV . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie &apos;s friend has so many movie channels .
&#91; Time card : 45 MINUTES LATER &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : Ha-ha , that movie was so dumb .
&#91; looks at nonexistent watch &#93; Oh , poop !
Johnnie &apos;s meeting !
I wonder how it went .
&#91; The light turns on . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie !
Oh , Johnnie , you &apos;re home !
How &apos;d it go ?
Oh , don &apos;t keep me in suspense , Johnnie !
Johnnie : I did it , babe !
I landed the sale !
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie , that &apos;s wonderful !
Johnnie : And I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Lumpy Space Princess : I know !
Johnnie : And here &apos;s the best part !
She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , my Glob !
It &apos;s gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle .
It &apos;s been a while .
Johnnie : Oh .
No .
It &apos;s a business meeting , not social .
Just me and the princess , I &apos;m afraid .
Lumpy Space Princess : What ? !
&#91; storms out &#93; Johnnie : LSP ?
Lumpy Space Princess : So ... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory ?
Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions ?
&#91; floats by a mudscamp &#93; Yo , think again , tranch .
Mudscamp : Who — who are you talking to ?
&#91; The scene cuts to the royal dinner . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom ?
Johnnie : Oh , it &apos;s just great .
I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern .
Princess Bubblegum : That &apos;s wonderful , Johnnie .
Now tell me more about gas ... Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; watching from outside &#93; Oh , Johnnie ...
Ugly Johnnie , through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly .
&#91; sighs &#93; Every relationship , I gamble with my heart .
I go all in because the payoff is true love .
I see you when I close my eyes , and thinking of you makes my mind feel light .
All my problems fade away , and I can &apos;t help smiling .
Heh .
To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person .
I don &apos;t know ... if I can be that big .
&#91; lights Molotov cocktail and throws it through a window &#93; Rah !
&#91; pulls wires from beneath a truck , causing it to roll &#93; Eh , ehh .
&#91; The truck rolls up the castle steps and explodes inside , rocking the whole castle . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; gasps &#93; We &apos;re under attack !
&#91; runs out &#93; Johnnie : Can I help ?
Princess Bubblegum : No .
Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth .
There &apos;s cyanide-laced gum under the table .
Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door .
&#91; closes door &#93; Johnnie : Okay .
&#91; hides under table &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; lifts up tablecloth &#93; Hi , Johnnie .
Johnnie : &#91; gasps &#93; What are you doing here ?
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern — back to when you loved me — so we can have a second chance .
Johnnie : What ?
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess places the sphere around Johnnie &apos;s head and pushes a button on her glove , sending Johnnie &apos;s head &apos;s molecules into limbo . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Uh !
&#91; does the same to Johnnie &apos;s body &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; At the site of the explosion , Manfried is fighting the fire with a garden hose . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Manfried , where are the Banana Guards ?
Manfried : Take a chill pill , Princess .
I handled it .
Princess Bubblegum : What did you handle ?
Manfried : You know .
Someone drove their car in the door , but no one was driving , and it exploded , so I handled it .
Princess Bubblegum : Mmm .
&#91; runs back to the dining room and kicks down the door &#93; Don &apos;t chew it !
Don &apos;t chew it !
Don &apos;t chew it !
&#91; flips table , finding the time travel machine &#93; &#91; At the Candy Tavern , Tree Trunks is still singing the same song while Lumpy Space Princess is looking around expectantly . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Johnnie ?
C &apos;mon .
Sit up straight .
Let me see them eyes .
Ha-ha .
Uh .
Princess Bubblegum : He &apos;s not here .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; gasps &#93; What ?
But I sent him back .
Princess Bubblegum : The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function .
Lumpy Space Princess : Well , then where is he ?
Princess Bubblegum : I don &apos;t know .
&#91; Johnnie &apos;s head begins materializing in the border around the screen . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; crying &#93; Then if he &apos;s gone , can you send me back ... ?
&#91; Johnnie &apos;s body materializes in the border . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : To before I met him so I won &apos;t have to remember this heartache ? !
Princess Bubblegum : If that &apos;s what you want .
Lumpy Space Princess : Do it .
Do it !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum places the sphere around Lumpy Space Princess and pushes buttons on her glove , sending Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s molecules back to when she first entered the sphere .
Meanwhile , in the border , Johnnie reunites his head and body . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : You witch !
Give them to — huh , wha ?
What ?
Where are we ?
&#91; Johnnie reaches out to Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : You asked me to use this .
Lumpy Space Princess : Don &apos;t touch me !
&#91; floats away &#93; You pretty skunk !
You don &apos;t know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns ... !
&#91; floats out the window &#93; &#91; Johnnie bows his head , crestfallen , as the border fades to black . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; sighs &#93; &#91; sits down and pours herself a drink &#93; &#91; Episode starts at Finn and Jake &apos;s Tree Fort .
BMO climbs into a dark room with assorted objects . &#93;
BMO : Hello ?
&#91; BMO climbs down a ladder to get into the room .
He finds a cardboard box and hides underneath it .
He starts chuckling .
On his screen , a digital hand selects some files .
The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can , deleting them .
BMO &apos;s screen glitches , and BMO seems woozy .
He chuckles and then looks normal .
Scene switches to outside of the box .
We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box .
He still seems dizzy .
We see him selecting the file &quot; CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys &quot; and then deleting it .
The scene shows his face , which turns from a smile into a frown .
BMO &apos;s screen glitches out wildly as BMO moans .
BMO gets up and wanders around for a second , before falling over .
The screen is blank . &#93;
Finn : BMO ?
&#91; Scene shows Finn and Jake looking down at something .
The image is distorted . &#93;
Jake : BMO ?
&#91; BMO is lying in a bed .
BMO wakes up . &#93;
Finn : BMO , are you okay ?
Jake : What did you do ?
BMO : It wasn &apos;t me .
I didn &apos;t do noth- do noth- do nothing .
&#91; BMO repeats &apos; do noth- &apos; because of his system glitching . &#93;
Finn : Come on BMO .
We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs .
BMO : No , no .
I am fine .
Really .
&#91; BMO &apos;s screen glitches out and BMO yells in pain .
He emits smoke and stops glitching . &#93;
Oh , yes .
Okay .
Please take me to get fixed .
I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed .
We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands , where I was born .
Finn : The MO Factory ?
BMO : Yeah .
I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there .
Come on !
There &apos;s no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose .
&#91; Scene changes to Bad Lands , just outside the MO Co . BMO is telling Finn and Jake where to go . &#93;
BMO : Okay .
Now straight down this place .
Okay , now take a right- right- right- right- left up here .
The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs .
Don &apos;t let on what happened ... or all the years we &apos;ve been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven !
Finn : Tears in the oven ?
&#91; gloomy sounds &#93; But memories are real , real cruc &apos; &#91; ial &#93; !
BMO : Yeah , no fooling .
Oh wait , there &apos;s more !
It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory .
Wait what ?
Oh , that &apos;s just great .
Jake : Hey , hey .
Don &apos;t worry buddy .
We &apos;re Finn and Jake , remember ?
Or should I say ... &#91; Jake transforms into a MO . &#93;
Finn and JMO !
BMO : &#91; laughs &#93; Wow !
Finn : Hey BMO , check this out , too !
&#91; Finn puts his backpack on BMO &apos;s arms .
He pulls his arms into his sleeves and pulls his shirt up over his head and over BMO &apos;s legs , making it seem like Finn has BMO for a head . &#93;
Meet FMO .
BMO : Finn , you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re dumb- you &apos;re da man !
This is gonna be a snap !
&#91; Scene changes to inside of the entrance of the MO factory .
Finn falls over . &#93;
Jake : Hello , there .
DMO : Greetings , and welcome to MO Co .
I &apos;m DMO .
Please state your business .
Jake : Hey there , DMO .
I am JMO .
Finn : And I &apos;m FMO !
DMO : Greetings , JMO .
FMO , you look ridiculous .
Are you damaged ?
Are you in need of repair ?
Finn : Yes , absolutely .
Thanks , DMO .
I busted my core system drivers , and now I need new ones .
DMO : Fantastic .
Okay .
Please get ready for your total personality wipe .
&#91; A hole opens in the wall beside DMO and an EMO comes out , twirling a lasso . &#93;
Finn : Oh , right , right .
Uh , right .
I mean , no .
I &apos;m just here for the ... nostalgic purposes .
DMO : Ah , yes .
47.3 % of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz .
Please step 100 % on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour .
&#91; Finn and Jake step onto the tram .
DMO is lowered from his original position , and a chair pops up on the tram , bringing up DMO to the driver seat . &#93;
DMO : Greetings .
&#91; He starts the tram . &#93;
Finn : Wup !
DMO : We are now passing over the famous factory floor .
Birthplace of each and every MO .
Behold the gleaming machinery !
Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation .
From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO .
Jake : But nothing &apos;s moving down there .
It &apos;s all shut down .
What happened to this place ?
DMO : I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m just a tram MO .
I &apos;m not programmed to understand that question .
Also , you &apos;re just a JMO .
You &apos;re not programmed to ask that question .
Jake : Uh , what question ?
DMO : That question- &#91; grunts with frustration &#93; Jake : I &apos;m serious ... DMO : Anyway , MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago .
By Moseph Mastro Giovanni .
A sad and gentle man .
Beloved by only those he built to belove him .
On your left , you &apos;ll see the core system driver installation port bay .
BMO : &#91; gasps &#93; Finn !
Finn !
That &apos;s it !
That &apos;s where the driver ports are !
Finn : I know , I heard !
&#91; Finn jumps off of the tram and into the room along with Jake . &#93;
DMO : What ? !
Are you crazy ? !
Get back here !
&#91; The room has outlets in the back of the wall .
They each correspond to a different MO from AMO-GMO .
The B port is covered up . &#93;
Jake : Hurry , Finn .
I think he &apos;s calling the police or somethin &apos; !
Finn : None of these ports fit right !
E , D , C , where &apos;s the B port ? !
&#91; Outside of the room where the trams travel , a new tram drives up , carrying four SMOs . &#93;
SMO 1 : Intruder spotted !
Prepare to vaporize !
Vaporize !
&#91; The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room .
Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves .
SMO 1 : Cease fire !
No intruder spotted .
Vaporization complete .
SMO 2 : Um , but what if they slipped past us , sir ?
In all the smoke ?
SMO 1 : Allllright , everyone .
About face .
&#91; All four SMOs turn around . &#93;
Does anyone see the intruders now ?
&#91; The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks annoyed . &#93;
Like I said , vaporization complete .
Now let &apos;s head back to base .
It &apos;s donut o &apos; clock .
&#91; Scene changes to a kind of office kitchen .
There is a table with chairs , a vending machine , a refrigerator and a microwave . &#93;
SMO 3 : Man , how about those goofs ?
Tryin &apos; to mess with our drivers ?
SMO 4 : Yeah .
You know the world these days .
All goofs .
&#91; SMO 4 takes his gun and gets donuts out of the vending machine with it . &#93;
SMO 1 : Hey !
You toss me one of them &apos; nuts ?
&#91; SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen , as if to drink it . &#93;
Ah .
Yeah , hey , speaking of goofs ?
Haven &apos;t seen SMO 5681 lately .
SMO 3 : &#91; while rubbing a coffee mug on his side &#93; Man , that goof .
SMO 1 : Yeah , I hate that goof .
&#91; SMO 1 rubs the donut on his screen like he is eating it . &#93;
You ever notice goofs always askin &apos; how you &apos;re doin &apos; ?
What is that ?
Uh , yeah , I &apos;m fine .
SMO 3 : Yeah , 100 % .
&#91; SMO 4 tries to throw donuts straight from the bag into his mouth , but they keep hitting the screen and falling to the floor .
From somewhere in the room , the sound of feet walking gets SMO 1 &apos;s attention . &#93;
SMO 1 : Oh !
Hey , what are you doing over there by yourself ?
&#91; An SMO with an orange screen and orange legs turns around . &#93;
SMO 5 : Uh , oh , I-- I &apos;m sad .
SMO 1 : Oh , yeah , y &apos;know we &apos;ve all been there .
&#91; to the other SMOs : &#93; So anyway , how &apos;s your goofy wife doin &apos; ?
&#91; The scene pans over to SMO 5 .
We see the inside of SMO 5 , which is really just Finn , BMO , and Jake hiding inside an SMO shell .
They are using Jake as the face and legs of the SMO . &#93;
Finn : &#91; whispering : &#93; BMO , how are you doing ?
BMO : Get me close to that guy &apos;s port .
I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is !
&#91; BMO &apos;s screen shows him barfing . &#93;
Jake : Ah , we gotta hustle !
SMO 1 : &#91; in response to something someone else said : &#93; Yeah , pretty good , I guess .
I prefer something yeastier .
The wife is always giving me grief about that .
But I mean , what am I , decent ?
&#91; Inside the SMO shell , while SMO 1 is talking , Jake takes a cord from BMO and plugs it into the back of SMO 1 .
Suddenly , SMO 1 &apos;s face is shocked and is then frozen as BMO accesses the file &quot; MAP.MO &quot; .
He starts shaking . &#93;
SMO 4 : Hey , what are you two goofs doin &apos; ?
Goofing ?
&#91; We see inside the SMO shell again , and we see the map on BMO &apos;s screen .
The map scrolls down to the bottom . &#93;
Jake : Dang , man , how deep does this place go ?
Finn : Down , right , left , down , corkscrew , down .
&#91; memorizing it : &#93; Down , right , left , down , corkscrew , down .
&#91; They throw down SMO 1 and jump out of the shell . &#93;
Finn : Psych !
&#91; Finn , Jake , and BMO start running away . &#93;
SMO 3 : Hey , woah !
&#91; The three get to a metal grate . &#93;
Finn : Down that grate !
&#91; Jake breaks it and they go under it .
We see seven SMOs after them , telling them to stop .
The scene changes to below the grate .
The three fall down perfectly timed with the tram , driven by DMO .
They land right on top of it .
They look behind them and see an SMO poking his head out of the ceiling . &#93;
DMO : Hey !
Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000 % !
&#91; DMO walks down to where Finn , Jake , and BMO are . &#93;
Get off of my tram !
Jake : Cram your tram !
&#91; Jake minimizes to DMO &apos;s size .
He runs over and kicks DMO off of the tram . &#93;
Womp !
&#91; Finn turns to look at him and gives smiles at him , raising his fists in the air .
Jake pulls a lever by the driver &apos;s seat , making them go even faster .
Finn laughs and looks down at BMO . &#93;
Finn : Hang in there , BMO !
&#91; BMO flashes a weak thumbs up on his screen . &#93;
Finn : Hey , Jake !
Can this thing go any fast- &#91; Finn is interrupted by an explosion behind him .
He and BMO are thrown to the front of the tram . &#93;
Finn : Woah !
Shoot , it &apos;s the fuzz !
&#91; Behind them , a tram with ten SMOs and DMO is following them . &#93;
DMO : Hit &apos; em again !
&#91; The SMOs shoot the tram .
Almost half of the tram is gone . &#93;
Finn : Holy- Jake : Finn , how are we getting to BMO &apos;s driver port ? !
Finn : Uh , turn right !
&#91; Jake turns the tram right .
The SMOs tram continues forward , but using a shortcut , they get behind them again . &#93;
Finn : Dog it , they &apos;re still behind us !
&#91; &quot; They drive through a 2D DNA-like path .
Unlike a strand of DNA , there is only one looping part .
Finn and Jake are driving in a straight line down the middle of the &apos; DNA &apos; as the SMOs tram loops around them . &#93;
Finn : Turn left !
&#91; They drive through a road beneath another .
The SMO &apos;s tram goes on the top road . &#93;
Finn : Turn Corkscrew !
&#91; They now drive in a 3D DNA-like path .
This time , there is two curves .
The two trams loop around each other .
Eventually , they merge into one track . &#93;
Finn : Now go down !
&#91; Jake makes the tram face completely downward .
Finn , Jake , and BMO fall off .
Jake stretches into a shield below them .
They break through three different floors .
One room has a B port , but they fall too quickly . &#93;
Finn : There &apos;s a driver port !
&#91; In the last room they fall through , Jake turns into a parachute .
They land on the floor of a huge , white room .
Finn and Jake groan with their pains from falling . &#93;
Finn : Too spicy .
Jake : My bod !
&#91; Behind them , ten SMOs and DMO from the tram fall through the ceiling , crashing on top of one another . &#93;
SMO 6 : Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility !
BMO : &#91; weakly : &#93; I am not non-MO .
&#91; SMO 6 still charges his laser gun &#93; BMO : &#91; louder : &#93; I am BMO !
&#91; SMO 6 shoots his laser at the ceiling so he doesn &apos;t shoot anybody . &#93;
SMO 6 : &#91; whispering , in awe : &#93; BMO .
&#91; A light flashes in the faces of the SMOs . &#93;
Moe : BMO ?
Did I hear BMO ?
Jake : Wait , what &apos;s up ?
&#91; We see the lights are coming from a room with MMO and Moe .
MMO takes Moe out of his chair and cradles him .
MMO carries him down to where Finn , Jake , the SMOs and where DMO is , with little unknown MOs trailing behind , holding life support equipment and tools &#93; Moe : Hey , I &apos;m Moe !
&#91; Moe taps MMO twice on the head .
MMO drops him .
Moe laughs . &#93;
Don &apos;t worry !
My legs don &apos;t work !
Finn : You &apos;re Moe ? !
Wait , are you human , too ?
Moe : My skin is human !
Jake : Dude , how old are you ? !
Moe : Hey , come on , now !
&#91; Moe crawls over to where BMO is .
He turns him so BMO is sitting down . &#93;
It is BMO !
Looks like there &apos;s some software problems !
&#91; Moe turns BMO off .
He opens his face plate .
He looks at the inside of him with a frown . &#93;
Hmm .
Finn : So ... you made BMO ?
Jake : &#91; Jake stretches to a large size . &#93;
Hey , you &apos;re not gonna reset our friend &apos;s personality , are you ?
Moe : Huh ?
What ?
No ... BMO &apos;s one of a kind .
I built BMO to take care of my son .
&#91; A CMO brings over a screwdriver . &#93;
Oh , thank you .
But I guess I never ended up dating any women .
So , that &apos;s sad .
&#91; Moe chuckles . &#93;
I sent BMO off into the world alone .
&#91; Moe coughs a couple of times while saying : &#93; Hoping to find a family home .
And then maybe even find somebody else &apos;s little boy to take care of .
Finn : Aw .
Moe : Oh , there &apos;s that back-up driver disk !
&#91; A CMO is holding a small floppy disk . &#93;
Thank you .
&#91; The CMO gives him the OK sign and smiles . &#93;
&#91; Moe puts the disk drive into a slot in BMO .
Some lights flash .
The system shoots the disk back out . &#93;
That oughta done it .
I must &apos;ve built what , like , a million MOs .
But BMO is very , very special .
I built BMO to understand fun .
And how to play .
&#91; extends an arm and something makes a cracking sound &#93; You see , I made BMO to be more .
&#91; Moe turns BMO on . &#93;
BMO : Ooh !
Are you my grandpoop ?
Moe : Nah , I &apos;m just your poop .
&#91; BMO gasps and runs up to Moe to give him a hug . &#93;
Jake : Wait , did you say you built a million robots ?
Finn : Yeah , all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks !
Moe : Ah , those were just the surface jerks .
&#91; to MMO : &#93; Up , please .
&#91; MMO lifts him up over himself .
He carries him over to a porthole in the ground with a wheel . &#93;
Kid , come over here .
&#91; He turns the wheel and the scene shows what &apos;s inside .
There are a couple hundred MOs milling about .
We see a QMO watering plants , an unknown MO with wings , two LMOs throwing dice and money , two CMOs playing jump rope with an OMO while a WMO , PMO , and three ♥ MOs looking at them . &#93;
BMO , say hello to your family .
BMO : Hello , family .
&#91; All of the MOs turn up to look at him . &#93;
MOs : Hi , BMO !
&#91; BMO puts his hands on his smiling face . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn and Jake fighting a group of Slider Guys .
Finn ineffectually swats at a couple with what is left of his Demon Blood Sword while Jake punches and kicks them away . &#93;
Finn : Thanks , bro !
Jake : There for you , bro ... but Finn , I &apos;m gonna tell you something gently .
Finn : &#91; concerned &#93; Okay .
What is it , bro ?
Jake : Get a new sword .
Finn : What you do mean ?
Jake : Bro , these guys could &apos;ve hurt you .
Finn : It still works .
&#91; swings it &#93; Hyut !
Jake : Bro ... Finn : I love this sword .
&#91; hugs it &#93; Jake : It &apos;ll be okay .
Let &apos;s go shopping !
&#91; The scene switches to a marketplace , where several townspeople are selling their goods . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : Candles !
Candles !
Candles for all occasions !
Jake : Hey !
There &apos;s Choose Goose !
&#91; looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly &#93; Goose !
Come on !
&#91; realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him &#93; Finn ?
What &apos;s wrong ?
Finn : Mm , maybe we should try someone else .
Jake : What ?
But we have history with him — that &apos;s important in business .
Finn : Yeah , but we &apos;re lookin &apos; for a sword .
Remember that armor he sold us ?
&#91; motions his hands in the shape of an hourglass &#93; Jake : &#91; winces &#93; Ooh .
Yeah , okay .
&#91; The two walk on . &#93;
Jake : I asked around .
This is the place to get sa-words .
&#91; motions to a grass tipi in front of them &#93; Finn : Oh .
Doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s open .
&#91; The tipi opens , revealing an &quot; OPEN &quot; sign . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : Open !
&#91; They walk inside . &#93;
Voice : Close the curtains behind you , please .
&#91; Finn does so . &#93;
Voice : Walk towards the candle .
&#91; They approach the man at the counter , who is wearing sunglasses and a cloak . &#93;
Man : How can I help you ?
Finn : Need a sword .
Man : Hold on .
&#91; brings out a sword &#93; Here you go : a grass sword .
It &apos;s a bargain .
Finn : I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve never used a grass sword before .
Maybe we should keep lookin &apos; .
Man : Swords like this don &apos;t come around every day .
Finn : Don &apos;t come around every day , uh ?
&#91; wields the sword &#93; I love it .
Jake : Well , that was easy .
Man : &#91; as Finn and Jake walk out &#93; Remember , no take backs .
&#91; Finn practices with the sword as a townsperson pushes up a cart loaded with pillows . &#93;
Jake : Hey , the pillow vendor !
&#91; The scene changes to Finn and Jake walking through the woods .
Jake is carrying a pillow while Finn is practicing with his sword .
Suddenly , a pizza flies out of the bushes . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Hyut !
&#91; slices it in half &#93; Jake : Huh ?
Pizza ? !
Finn : Yeah !
Came outta nowhere !
It was gonna bonk you on the head .
Jake : You &apos;re getting good with that sword .
You were never able to do that with your other swords .
Finn : No more pizza bonks .
Hyut !
&#91; swishes the sword &#93; Hey , we &apos;re near Tree Trunks &apos; house .
Let &apos;s stop by and get some pie .
Jake : Pie !
&#91; They approach Tree Trunks &apos; house . &#93;
Finn : &#91; swishing sword &#93; Hyut !
Hyut !
&#91; They walk inside &#93; Finn : Hyaaaah ! ♪ Tree Trunks : Howdy , boys !
Nice pillow and nice sword .
My hands are full , Finn .
Uh , you mind slicin &apos; an apple for me ?
&#91; rolls an apple toward him &#93; Finn : Hyut !
&#91; slices apple perfectly &#93; Tree Trunks : Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword .
Jake : He &apos;s gettin &apos; really good .
He saved me from pizza .
Tree Trunks : That apple slicing is too perfect ... demonically perfect .
That sword is cursed !
Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; laugh &#93; Jake : I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious .
&#91; The scene changes to inside Finn and Jake &apos;s bedroom .
Finn is practicing with his sword while wearing pajamas and Jake is making his bed . &#93;
Jake : Uh , how &apos;s that curse doin &apos; ?
Makin &apos; you want to moidle me ?
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : No , man .
This sword doesn &apos;t seem to have any curse on it , as far as I can tell .
&#91; stabs at the air &#93; Hyah !
Jake : Well , okay .
&#91; tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth &#93; Dang tag .
Finn : I got it !
Jake : Hmm ?
&#91; Finn quickly slices at the tag with his sword .
The tag falls apart as it is revealed that the sword cut it in the shape of Finn &apos;s face . &#93;
Jake : &#91; gasps &#93; Finn : Whoa !
Jake : Hey , quit showin &apos; off , bro !
Finn : Sorry , man .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I-I ...
I &apos;ll go put this away .
Jake : Good idea .
&#91; puts the pillow in his bed , gets on top of it , and starts sleeping &#93; &#91; Finn puts the sword in a chest .
The scene switches to him in bed , moaning softly in his sleep .
In his dream , the sword emerges from the grassy field , dissipates , and reforms in his hand .
The sword wiggles , and grass starts spreading over Finn &apos;s body .
Finn screams but is muffled by the grass .
His whole body becomes like topiary , then blows away in the wind .
Finn wakes up . &#93;
Finn : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; pants &#93; Huh ?
&#91; unzips sleeping bag , finding the sword in his hand &#93; &#91; The sword extends grass from the hilt onto Finn &apos;s wrist , wrapping itself around his arm . &#93;
Finn : What the — ?
&#91; pants frantically &#93; &#91; He runs outside and shrieks , swinging the sword around in an attempt to get it off .
He runs into the forest and bites some of it off , but it grows back .
He covers his left hand with his pajamas and manages to pull it off his right hand . &#93;
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; Jeez .
&#91; The sword extends its grassy hands toward him , trying to reattach itself .
Finn drops it and kicks it toward a cliff . &#93;
Finn : Stupid ... &#91; kicks it &#93; thing !
&#91; It falls into the river below . &#93;
Worst three bucks I &apos;ve ever spent .
&#91; The scene changes back to Finn in his bed .
He suddenly wakes up . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; looks at his arm , seeing no sword &#93; Whew .
&#91; In the bathroom , he brushes his teeth and opens the cabinet for some floss .
As he closes it , he sees the sword behind him in the mirror , still dripping wet . &#93;
Finn : &#91; shrieks &#93; Jake : What &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Finn : The sword is after my flesh !
Jake : Huh ?
&#91; The sword wiggles its appendages . &#93;
Jake : Oh , snap !
Finn : Don &apos;t let it get me , Jake !
Jake : Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll handle this .
&#91; wraps his apron around the sword &apos;s hilt and sheathes it in a baguette &#93; There .
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; Let &apos;s go return that junk .
&#91; At the marketplace , the place where the grass tipi was is now a patch of dirt with a &quot; FOR RENT &quot; sign in the middle . &#93;
Jake : Huh .
Hey , he &apos;s not here .
Finn : Hmm .
Maybe someone around here knows where he is .
&#91; They hear screams for help from offscreen . &#93;
Finn : Somebody in trouble !
&#91; They run toward the source of the cries . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : Help !
They &apos;re taking our candles !
Jake : It &apos;s the Hooligans Who Love Candles !
Finn : Let &apos;s get &apos; em !
&#91; drops his pack and sword &#93; Hey !
Hooligans carrying candle : Huh ?
&#91; Finn kicks the candle out of their grip . &#93;
Hooligan : Yo !
You got a prob , Bob ?
Finn : Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral !
&#91; punches them &#93; &#91; kicks another in the face &#93; Another hooligan : Anarchy !
&#91; throws candle at Finn &#93; Finn : &#91; catches it and throws it back &#93; School !
&#91; kicks him &#93; Hyah !
&#91; Jake runs by chasing two more hooligans . &#93;
Hooligans : Aah !
Stop chasing us !
&#91; Finn continues fighting , then rests , panting .
A hooligan holding a candle comes up from behind . &#93;
Hooligan : Happy birthday .
&#91; bashes Finn &apos;s head with candle &#93; &#91; Finn falls to the ground and holds his head .
He looks up to see five of the hooligans upon him . &#93;
Hooligan : &#91; brandishing candle &#93; You &apos;re dead , teddy boy .
&#91; Finn looks down to see the sword wrapped around his wrist again . &#93;
Finn : No .
&#91; The hooligan lifts the candle above his head in slow motion , coming in for another hit , but Finn quickly gets up and slices at the candle multiple times .
The candle falls apart in the shape of Finn &apos;s face .
While the hooligans are taken aback , Finn leaps over them while slicing at their hair .
After he lands , their hair falls off and they run away screaming . &#93;
Suzy &amp; Sue : You &apos;ve saved our shop !
Sue : Thank you so much , you brave young man .
Suzy : And don &apos;t even worry about the damages .
Sue : We &apos;ll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness .
Suzy : Oh , and we &apos;ll put it right by the entrance , and it &apos;ll be our mascot — the candle man !
&#91; The sword grips Finn &apos;s wrist tightly . &#93;
Jake : Dude ... &#91; winces &#93; Finn : Yeah ... not comin &apos; off .
Jake : Don &apos;t give up , man .
Hey , maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went .
&#91; The scene changes to them walking up to Choose Goose &apos;s stall . &#93;
Jake : Hey , Choogles !
We need your help .
We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword .
You know who he is ?
Choose Goose : I know you did business with some rando guy .
Help you backstabbers — Why should I ?
Jake : What ?
Come on , Choogie , it was only one time .
Choose Goose : Hmm .
&#91; Finn slices at a fly , but knocks down some of Choose Goose &apos;s wares . &#93;
Finn : I made a mistake , CG .
This merch is totally defective .
&#91; earnestly &#93; Please .
Choose Goose : Okay-dokay ...
I know that quack with the grassy shack .
He &apos;s a wizard from the grassy plain .
He lives atop the grassy moun ... tayn .
Jake : Awesome .
Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn ... Mountain .
Yeah , thanks , Choogs .
Finn : Yeah , thanks !
&#91; Finn and Jake start walking off . &#93;
Choose Goose : &#91; shouting after them &#93; He &apos;s the only one who can lift the curse , but beware ... &#91; Finn and Jake stop in their tracks and turn around . &#93;
Choose Goose : He &apos;s a huge ding-wad — just the worst .
&#91; The scene switches to Finn and Jake running toward the grassy mountain .
Suddenly , some grass monsters emerge from the side of the hill .
Finn slices the head off each one as he runs by . &#93;
Finn : Chop , chop , chop , chop , chop !
&#91; In front of them , a giant Grass Bear grows out of the ground .
It growls and spits at them and steps toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; Finn gets Jake out of the way of the monster &apos;s foot and slices its leg in the shape of his face without even looking .
The monster howls while balancing on one foot .
Finn flicks the blade of his sword , causing it to rapidly spin like a propeller .
The monster spits at them some more , then collapses on top of them .
Finn uses the sword to blast his way out from under the mound of grass .
The blade stops spinning and they continue up the mountain . &#93;
Finn : Hmm .
For a cursed dingus , you cut so good .
&#91; They reach the shack at the top of the mountain . &#93;
Finn : Come forth , wizard , and uncurse my mitt !
Grassy Mountain Wizard !
&#91; The door opens and out steps the guy who sold Finn his sword .
He casts aside his cloak and sunglasses . &#93;
Grassy Wizard : Comin &apos; up here tryin &apos; to enter my house !
Are you for real ? !
&#91; uses his powers to bring out his household objects made of grass &#93; Mow &apos; em down , my cursed grassy objects !
&#91; sends them flying through the air toward Finn and Jake &#93; Finn : Hyah !
&#91; slices all the objects while running toward the wizard &#93; Grassy Wizard : Uh ... go forth !
Go ... uh , forth .
&#91; looks inside his house &#93; That was all my grassy objects .
&#91; Finn lands in front of him , knocking the wizard backwards . &#93;
Finn : &#91; points his sword at the wizard &#93; Lift the curse .
Grassy Wizard : &#91; laughs &#93; Never !
You have no power over me , young fool !
The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity !
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : &#91; contemplates for a moment &#93; Hmm .
You know what ?
&#91; backs off from wizard &#93; I think I &apos;m cool with that .
&#91; The sword retracts and wraps around Finn &apos;s arm . &#93;
Grassy Wizard : What ?
Finn : Whoa .
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; extends and retracts his sword a few times &#93; Jake : Now that you &apos;ve accepted it , you can control it !
Finn : &#91; extends it &#93; Yeah .
&#91; retracts it &#93; This is really cool !
&#91; extends it &#93; I just had to get used to it .
&#91; retracts it &#93; Grassy Wizard : That &apos;s not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse !
Finn &amp; Jake : Whatevs .
&#91; They run down the mountain while Finn retracts and extends his sword . &#93;
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Do it again !
&#91; laughs &#93; Finn : Get it , get it !
&#91; A ladybug hisses at him &#93; Finn : &#91; Jumps with a sword . &#93;
Yah !
Jake : &#91; Jumps with a lion-shape shield . &#93;
Oooooooh !
&#91; They land on the ground and Finn raises his sword with light blasting out of it .
He runs up to the ladybug and chops the ground in front of it .
The lady bug climbs onto his sword . &#93;
Jake : Get him out !
&#91; Finn goes outside . &#93;
Finn : Don &apos;t you ever let me catch you here again !
&#91; Finn puts the ladybug in the grass and goes inside . &#93;
Finn : Whoo-hoo !
Ya ha ha ha ha !
&#91; Closes the door &#93; Agh !
Ow !
&#91; Zooms in to a little splinter &#93; Ooooooow !
Agh agh mee duh !
Jake : Did he get you with his poison stingers ?
Finn : No , I got a splinter from the door .
Jake : Let me see .
Wow , that &apos;s a tiny splinter .
Finn : But it hurts !
I &apos;m gonna need some ... &#91; Flashes to a different scene with a thimble on Finn &apos;s finger &#93; ... finger protection !
Thanks , Choose Goose .
Choose Goose : I am Choose Goose .
Come back for some juice !
Ha ha ha ha ha !
Finn : Man , I am so protected right now !
&#91; Finn and Jake hear knights talking . &#93;
Knight 1 : That is mighty thick .
Go on , hit me !
&#91; Another knight hits him with a sword and it breaks in half .
They clap .
Knight 2 makes an okay sign with his fingers and the other knights cheer . &#93;
Finn : Hey guys !
Check this out !
Dude , hit me !
&#91; Jake punches Finn on the arm &#93; Oww !
&#91; Holding his arm &#93; On my armor !
Jake : Oh .
&#91; Punches thimble &#93; Finn : &#91; Makes an okay sign with his fingers &#93; Click-click !
&#91; Knights begin to laugh . &#93;
Knight 1 : That is but a thimble !
This &#91; Hits his armor twice &#93; is real armor !
&#91; They all laugh again but Sir Slicer shows up on his horse with birds calling and flying everywhere . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : Wha ?
All Knights : Sir Slicer !
&#91; All bow &#93; Sir Slicer : Who is the one that bears the thimble ?
Jake : This dude .
&#91; Points at Finn &#93; Sir Slicer : Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
Oh , you foolish boy .
Without full body armor , you &apos;re weak !
You do not look &#91; Makes okay sign with his fingers &#93; Click-click !
Ha ha ha ha .

&#91; Rides on his horse away and Finn and Jake run to Choose Goose . &#93;
Finn : Choose Goose , I need more armor .
Choose Goose : I &apos;ve got something for you -- &#91; Holds up metal shoe &#93; a metal shoe !

Finn : &#91; Cheeks turn more red &#93; No , Choose Goose .

What if you fall down and scrape your cheek ?
&#91; Knights continue to laugh &#93; One knight : Look at his butt !

&#91; Eyes glow &#93; Choose Goose : &#91; Gets the armor Finn wants &#93; Wonderful !
I &apos;ll need a trade of equal value .
I &apos;ll take the head of your dog friend !
Jake : Say what ?
Finn : No way !
Choose Goose , this stuff is overpriced !
Choose Goose : No money for me ?
How about a poem for free ?
&#91; Knights laugh some more on the ground and one falls over &#93; Finn : &#91; Looks at the knights and , cheeks turning red , looks back at Choose Goose &#93; A poem ?
Choose Goose : If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials , you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron .
It is foretold to be totally &#91; makes okay sign with his fingers &#93; Click-click !
Finn &amp; Jake : Skadow !
Choose Goose : &#91; Hands Finn the poem &#93; Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill .
Finn : Ah , yes !
I &apos;m gonna get that armor !
Jake : Yeah , man , you &apos;re gonna do it !
&#91; Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up &#93; Sir Slicer : Good luck exposing your soft , vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements , dork !
Haaaaaaa !
Later , losers !
&#91; Goes away on his horse &#93; Finn : Ja !
&#91; Cuts to another scene &#93; He &apos;s just jealous that I &apos;m gonna have cooler armor than him !
Jake : Yeah , what a bumbleberry !
Finn &amp; Jake : Whoa !
&#91; Comes to a place with lot of curtains &#93; Jake : What &apos;s the poem say ?
Finn : &quot; The sun nibbles on the clouds , and gum drop tears rain down . &quot;
I don &apos;t get it ... Jake : &#91; Feels the poem &#93; Hmm ...
It means that we have to cross that swamp .
Finn : How &apos;d you understand that ?
Jake : You don &apos;t just read the poetry to understand it .

Now get in there !
Finn : You &apos;re not coming ?
Jake : No way , man .

Finn : Huuuh ! ! !
&#91; Closes that one and opens another curtain and sees a mom giving a baby a shower &#93; The Mom : Aah !
Pervert !
Finn : I &apos;m not a pervert !
&#91; face turns more red &#93; The Mom : You should be ashamed of yourself !
Finn : I &apos;m sorry !

&#91; his whole face turns red and goes through lots of other curtains and finally gets to Jake .
Finn breathes hard &#93; Aah !
Man : My privates !
Finn : I &apos;m sorry !
Man 2 : My privates !
Finn : I &apos;m sorry !
Jake : You okay , man ?
Finn : No !
&#91; Sir Slicer shows up &#93; Sir Slicer : Ha ha ha ha ha !
Finn &amp; Jake : Wha ? !
Sir Slicer : What &apos;s the matter , crimson cheeks ?
Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment ?
&#91; Camera turns to Finn &#93; You &apos;re so red , you look like a tomato .
Ha ha ha ha !
&#91; Sir Slicer leaves on his horse &#93; Finn : Aahhhh !
We &apos;ll see who &apos;s embarrassed when I get that armor !
What does the poem say ?
Jake : &#91; feels the poem &#93; Hmm ... Ooh !
&quot; The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come . &quot;
Finn : What does that even mean ? !
Jake : It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods .
&#91; they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : Huh !
&#91; They see a Red-faced Monster crying &#93; Finn : Aw , man !
I don &apos;t know how to silence that !
Jake : All right , I &apos;ll handle this one , dude .
Finn : No .
This is my burden .
Jake : Then just make her think it &apos;s her idea .
That &apos;s how you make the ladies do what you want .
Finn : &#91; Walks up to the animal &#93; Hey , Monster Lady !
Hey !
Stop crying !
The Animal : Huh ?
Finn : Stop crying because that &apos;s what you want to do !
The Animal : Hu ha huh ?
&#91; picks Finn up and smiles &#93; Finn : Huh ? !
Ahh ! ! !
Ahh ! ! !
Ahh ahh ahh ! ! !
Ahh ahh ! ! !
&#91; The monster pictures Finn as her baby &#93; The Animal : Oho ... &#91; cradling Finn back and forth &#93; Jake : Ha ha ha !
She thinks you &apos;re her red-faced baby or something .
I think she wants ya to nurse , dude !
Finn : Noo ! ! !
The Animal : Aaa !
Ooh !
Mmm !
&#91; then Sir Slicer shows up &#93; Jake : Huh ?
Sir Slicer : Minstrel ?
&#91; A lyre player comes out and sings &quot; Finn the Blushing Baby &quot; &#93; Minstrel : &quot; He &apos;s Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red !
/ Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed ! &quot;
Sir Slicer : Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come .
Finn : Grandfathers will not sing that to their children !
&#91; The monster tries to chop Sir Slicer but he puts up his arm which had armor and hurt the monster &apos;s hand &#93; The Animal : Oh !
Sir Slicer : Armor , &#91; Makes okay sign with his fingers &#93; Click-click .
&#91; He leaves on his horse &#93; Finn : Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron !
Jake : Yeah !
Just you wait , weirdo !
&#91; Just then , a shadow cast over Jake &#93; Uh , Finn ?
Uh-oh .
&#91; the monster laid on Jake to take a nap &#93; Finn : Jake ?
You okay ?
Huh ?
&#91; just then Jake &apos;s arm came out of the fur on the animal right in front of Finn and came out the fur on the animals back &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : Yeah !
Finn : Awesome !
Jake : Yeah !
Finn &amp; Jake : Whoa !
&#91; They came to a door that says &quot; Home of Zeldron &apos;s Armor &quot; &#93; Finn : Finally !
&#91; kicks the door open &#93; Yah !
&#91; A ghost appears &#93; Ghost Man : Hello !
Finn : Begone , ghost !
I &apos;m here for the armor !
Ghost Man : First , you have to beat my high score in a game of Drop Ball &#91; throwing the ball in the air &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : Drop Ball ?
Ghost Man : Drop Ball is an extremely addictive , high-intensity game designed for people everywhere .
Here , let me show ya .
&#91; He throws the ball under him , bends down , and picks it up with his butt &#93; Hut !
One point .
&#91; Finn &apos;s face turns red &#93; Two points .
Three points .
Finn : This game looks awful .
Ghost Man : Oh , no .
I absolutely disagree !
Finn : &#91; to Jake &#93; Dude , let &apos;s just kill him and get the armor .
Jake : How ?
He &apos;s already dead .
Ghost Man : Here .
It &apos;s your turn .
Now , I don &apos;t want you to be intimidated , but my high score is six !
Finn : Guh !
Just -- just toss it on the ground .
&#91; He throws the ball under Finn , he put his arms on the ground and tries but couldn &apos;t go that low &#93; Ghost Man : No , no , no !
You &apos;re doing it all wrong !
Let me show you how the pros do it !
&#91; He bends his knees and picks it up &#93; See ?
It &apos;s all in the technique .
Now , I &apos;m gonna put a little finesse into it , just to shake things up .
&#91; Finn and Jake go to the next room while his back is turned &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : Whoa !
&#91; they see a big shiny light &#93; Jake : Finn , its so beautiful !
Finn : Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it .
&#91; Then orbs of the light come out &#93; Orb : Greetings , young traveler .
We know what you seek , and you shall receive it .
&#91; The light struck Finn putting him in the air &#93; Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron !
It will protect you from evil , even ghosts .
&#91; Then the light put it on Finn &#93; Finn : Huh ? !
Aah ! !
&#91; Which he found out it was a woman &apos;s armor &#93; No !
Dude , this is lady armor !
Jake : &#91; Makes okay sign with fingers &#93; Click-click !
Orb : &#91; Makes okay sign with fingers &#93; Click-click !
Finn : No !
Not Click-click !
No more embarrassment !
&#91; He takes it off &#93; I don &apos;t need armor !
Ghost Man : &#91; Kicks door open &#93; You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique !
Finn &amp; Jake : Huh ?
Ghost Man : I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows , and this is how you thank me ? !
I absolutely disagree with that !
&#91; turns in to a monster-like creature &#93; Raarg !
Finn : Now what ?
Jake : Put on the armor !
It &apos;ll protect you from evil , even ghosts !
Finn : Never !
Yaaaaaaah !
&#91; Finn runs up to the monster ghost , tries to punch him but goes through him &#93; Monster Ghost : &#91; Picks Finn up and starts to take his soul &#93; Jake : Hey !
Monster Ghost : Huh ?
&#91; Camera moves to Jake , wearing the Armor of Zeldron &#93; Monster Ghost : Mama ?
Jake : Uhh ... Yeah !
&#91; In a high pitched voice &#93; Listen when your mother is speaking to you !
Monster Ghost : Yes , Mama .
Jake : &#91; High pitched voice &#93; You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years .
You need to go outside and get some sunlight !
Monster Ghost : But I ... Jake : &#91; High pitched voice and is pointing &#93; No back talk !
Outside !
Now !
Monster Ghost : &#91; Puts Finn down and the monster ghost goes outside , burns from sunlight and then turns back to a normal person &#93; Finn : Whoa .
Person : Oh , thank you , Finn and Jake !
You &apos;ve freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball !
Jake : &#91; normal voice &#93; No problem , dude .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without &#91; pointing up &#93; the power of embarrassment !
Finn : And I learned I don &apos;t need armor to be -- &#91; Sir Slicer shows up &#93; Sir Slicer : Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
Look at you losers .
Finn , you don &apos;t have any armor , and your friend is dressed like a lady !
Ha ha ha !
So not Click-click !
Finn : Well , at least I don &apos;t spend my day following a kid around !
Get a life , dude !
Person and Jake : Ha ha ha ha Jake : Good one , Finn .
Person : Yeah ha ha .
Sir Slicer : Well , I &apos;ve ... just been in the same areas today .
Person &amp; Jake : Ha ha ha ha ha ha !
Person : Yeah , right !
Jake : Whatever !
Sir Slicer : Be quiet !
I -- I am more Click-click than all of you !
Finn : Come over here and say that to my fist !
Sir Slicer : Okay , I will !
&#91; Gets down from his horse , falls down and lands on side &#93; Whoa !
Er ... Ugh , this armor &apos;s too heavy !
Ah , no problem .
I &apos;ll just prop myself up on this stick .
&#91; Grabs a stick &#93; Aghhh !
Splinter !
Finn : Hey , Sir Slicer , maybe you can use this !
&#91; He holds up the thimble &#93; Here you go !
&#91; Throws it at Sir Slicer &apos;s face &#93; Sir Slicer : Oh !
Finn : Free of charge !
Jake : &#91; Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back &#93; Come on , dude , let &apos;s get out of here .
Finn : Ha ha !
&#91; Cheeks turn red &#93; Okay , buddy .
Jake : &#91; Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor &#93; Wa-hoo !
&#91; Flies over the 3 mountain tops , breaking them &#93; Dude , this armor is totally Click-click !
&#91; The episode starts when Finn finishes building Flame Princess &apos; new house , which Flame Princess loves . &#93;
Finn : Well , looks like your new house is done .
&#91; Throws helmet &#93; Whoop !
Jake !
You wanna check out the new house ?
Jake : Naah , &#91; Draws Lady Rainicorn on the dirt &#93; don &apos;t let me interrupt you .
You two have fun .
Flame Princess : &#91; Excited &#93; I wanna see inside !
&#91; Checks inside the house and merging with it &#93; &#91; Laughter &#93; I love it !
&#91; deep voice &#93; Finn : Great !
&#91; Fire touches Finn &#93; &#91; Quick sigh &#93; This doesn &apos;t hurt as bad as it used to .
&#91; Fire spreads throughout Finn &apos;s right leg &#93; &#91; Then panics &#93; Oh gob !
Oh gob !
Oh gob !
&#91; Dives into the nearby river &#93; Jake : &#91; Worried &#93; Finn !
&#91; Finn rises above the surface &#93; Finn : Haha , I &apos;m okay !
Flame Princess : &#91; Interested &#93; Hmmmm ... Finn : &#91; Laughter and splashes &#93; Flame Princess : Oh !
&#91; Requests &#93; Do the thing that I like .
Finn : &#91; Agrees and acts &#93; &#91; Sucking some water and squirts it upward like a sprinkler &#93; Flame Princess : &#91; Giggles &#93; Jake : &#91; Requests &#93; Now do the thing I like .
Finn : &#91; Agrees , acts and turns around , where his butt is facing &#93; &#91; Submerges , splashes and farts underwater gas bubbles for three times &#93; Jake : Hehehe , classic .
&#91; Stretches out his left hand to Finn &#93; Alright Finn , that &apos;s enough .
&#91; Pulls Finn out of the water &#93; &#91; Then Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form . &#93;
Flame Princess : Thank you for building my new home , Finn .
I &apos;m so happy .
Finn : &#91; Eyes sparkle &#93; You ... wanna hug ?
Flame Princess : Yes .
&#91; Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other and Jake interrupts for a moment . &#93;
Jake : Woah !
Hold on &quot; mama . &quot;
&#91; Then moments later , Jake wraps Finn with FOILED AGAIN tin foil like a burrito . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Pats the foil &#93; Okay bro , tin foil &apos;s on .
You can hug now .
&#91; Both Finn and Flame Princess approached each other again and blushed from back to front . &#93;
&#91; Then Flame Princess hugs Finn and her flames become a little stronger . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Weird smile &#93; &#91; Hug ends &#93; Finn : Bye .
Flame Princess : &#91; Whispers &#93; Bye , Finn .
&#91; Then Finn and Jake leaves &#93; Finn : &#91; Turns around &#93; Bye !
&#91; Loses some balance &#93; Flame Princess : &#91; Giggles and waves Good Bye at Finn . &#93;
&#91; Moments later &#93; Jake : Looks like your date went pretty good buddy .
Finn : Uh ...
I don &apos;t know , was the hug okay ?
Give me some tips man .
Jake : Bro , you gotta let things take their natural path .
Look , look &#91; Turns right arm to 15 small stairsteps &#93; , let me explain some junk about dating .
Right now , &#91; Points left finger to first step &#93; , you &apos;re at Tier 1 , which is hugging .
But pretty soon , &#91; Points left finger to second step &#93; you &apos;ll be at Tier 2 , which is smooching .
Then down the road &#91; points left finger to fifth step &#93; , you &apos;ll make it to Tier 5 , where she &apos;ll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong , beautiful stomach .
Then after awhile , you &apos;ll make it to Tier 8 &#91; points left finger to eighth step &#93; , where you touch her horn for the very first time .
Very special .
Finn : &#91; Very curious &#93; &#91; Pops out his left arm and points left finger to fifteenth step &#93; What about Tier 15 ?
Jake : &#91; Warns Finn while pointing his left finger at him &#93; You stay away from that !
Do not do Tier 15 !
Finn : &#91; Terrified &#93; Dude , I got no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
Jake : &#91; Undoes the 15 small stairsteps &#93; Don &apos;t worry about it dude , just let things naturally move to Tier 2 .
Oh and um , you need a shower dude .
Finn : What ? !
&#91; Pops out right arm &#93; &#91; Rips a bit of tinfoil &#93; &#91; Then sniffs self &#93; Oh gross .
&#91; Later , near the Tree Fort &#93; Finn : Do you think Flame Princess could smell me ?
&#91; At the front door &#93; Jake : Probably .
Finn : Crup .
&#91; Jake opens the front door &#93; Princess Bubblegum : &apos; Sup , guys ?
Finn and Jake : Princess Bubblegum ? !
Jake : What are you doing here ?
Princess Bubblegum : Collecting taxes , you guys weren &apos;t home .
So I let myself in .
Jake : Oh .
Finn : I &apos;m gonna take a shower .
Princess , do not inhale !
Princess Bubblegum : What ?
Why ?
Finn : Just don &apos;t .
&#91; Flips to the ladder and climbs up quickly &#93; Hyap !
Princess Bubblegum : What &apos;s that all about ?
Jake : Aah , he &apos;s just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Curious and interested &#93; Ooh , a lady-friend , do tell .
Jake : Uh , I shouldn &apos;t say .
It &apos;s his business .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Sits on the floor to hear better &#93; Oh , come on , you can tell me .
Jake : That &apos;s his personal biz , you gotta respect the man &apos;s p-biz .
Princess Bubblegum : Okay , you &apos;re right , I &apos;ll respect it .
&#91; Suddenly Jake reveals in an outburst &#93; Jake : Flame Princess !
He &apos;s hanging out with Flame Princess !
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Distraught &#93; What ? !
Jake : And I don &apos;t mean to be telling stories out of school .
But pretty soon , &#91; lowers voice &#93; they &apos;re gonna be taking it to Tier 2 .
Princess Bubblegum : No , this isn &apos;t possible .
Jake : Oh , it &apos;s possible .
Princess Bubblegum : I just never thought , Flame Princess .
I-uh-I have to go .
&#91; Moments later , outside the Tree Fort &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Morrow !
Morrow : &#91; Picks up Princess Bubblegum &#93; &#91; Inside the Tree Fort &#93; Jake : &#91; Confused &#93; Mmm , weird .
BMO : &#91; Climbs down the ladder &#93; Guess who &apos;s late for their video chat .
&#91; Opens the video chat and President Porpoise appears &#93; Jake : &#91; Gasps &#93; President Porpoise !
President Porpoise : &#91; Dolphin sounds &#93; &#91; Later at Princess Bubblegum &apos;s bedroom &#93; Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Opens the door quickly and runs to her bed &#93; No , no .
&#91; Gets her diary at the back of her pillow and writes down : FINN + LOVE + FLAME PRINCESS &#93; Oh gob , I thought I &apos;d be ready for this .
&#91; The next day &#93; &#91; Jake pulls out the contents out of the sack which was Princess Bubblegum &apos;s taxes to collect &#93; Finn : Yyyaawn !
&#91; Finn slides down the ladder , then jumps over Jake &#93; Whoop .
Jake , I &apos;m going to see Flame Princess , be back later .
&#91; Panting while running towards the door and then he opens it . &#93;
&#91; Suddenly Princess Bubblegum was standing in the doorway &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Finn !
Finn : &#91; Shrieks like a girl &#93; Jake : Ok Princess , you need to stop breaking in here .
Princess Bubblegum : I have something important to tell you .
About relationships .
Finn : Ah , that &apos;s okay , Princess .
Princess Bubblegum : I just hope , you &apos;ll understand .
&#91; Picks a crystal from her purse , then drops it to the floor and suddenly a holo-screen appears .
Next she moves the contents of the holo-screen &#93; Relationships &#91; drops her purse &#93; are like layers of sedimentary rock ....... Finn : Jake , Flame Princess is waiting for me .
I &apos;m gonna bounce out .
Jake : Uh , ok , &#91; lowers voice &#93; Tier 2 baby !
Finn : Word .
&#91; Then flips out of the Tree Fort &apos;s front door &#93; &#91; Jake turns around and sees more boring stuff . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : If too much frustration builds , the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form ...... &#91; Then Jake falls asleep and starts daydreaming &#93; Jake : What ?
Where am I ?
Mini-snowman : Jake , you &apos;re president now !
&#91; The Mini-snowman and the other 2 animals clap for Jake being the new president . &#93;
Jake : Oh my glosh !
&#91; Starts dancing &#93; &#91; Princess Bubblegum tries to wake up Jake &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Jake !
Jake : &#91; Groans for 3 times &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Wake up !
Jake : &#91; Groans another and regains consciousness &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Jake , where &apos;s Finn ?
Jake : He stepped out .
Princess Bubblegum : Will you tell him why he can &apos;t see Flame Princess anymore ?
Jake : Oh , oh !
&#91; Thinking Princess Bubblegum is jealous &#93; I see what &apos;s going on here !
Princess Bubblegum : Great !
I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other .
&#91; Then leaves the Tree Fort &#93; Jake : Oh man , PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess !
&#91; Several hours later , Finn returns home . &#93;
&#91; Moments later , inside the Tree Fort , Jake is playing with BMO &#93; BMO : Jump , punch , kick , kick !
Jake : What &apos;s up man ?
Finn : Yo , dude !
So what did Princess Bubblegum want ?
Jake : She doesn &apos;t want you see Flame Princess anymore .
She &apos;s crazy jealous !
Finn : &#91; Suddenly frowns &#93; Jake : So , you at Tier 2 yet ?
Finn : &#91; Recalls &#93; I got about five hugs , does that count ?
Jake : Nnoope .
Finn : &#91; Embarrassed &#93; Uhaah .. Well , I &apos;m still at Tier 1 .
Jake : I know exactly what &apos;ll get you Tier 2 .... A &quot; sappy poem . &quot;
&#91; Takes Finn to the bedroom &#93; &#91; Moments later , at their bedroom &#93; Jake : Say something about her &quot; spectrum . &quot;
Finn : Ee-eww !
Let &apos;s see .... She &apos;s bright .
She &apos;s beautiful .
She makes me feel ... confused , l-like something &apos;s filling up my chest , like I can &apos;t breathe , is it because she &apos;s so .. dangerous ?
Glob , Jake , I can &apos;t stand it !
&#91; Checks Jake &#93; Jake : &#91; Snoring while sleeping &#93; &#91; Then the sun rises and Finn looks at it for an idea . &#93;
&#91; Later outside , Finn sits near a tree facing the rising sun making a poem &#93; Finn : Inspiration ... &#91; Then writes again , thinks , rips out another paper , and starts writing again . &#93;
&#91; Princess Bubblegum suddenly appears nearby &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Finn !
Finn : &#91; Shrieks like a girl &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Whatcha doin &apos; ?
Finn : Oh , uh , hi , Princess .
I &apos;m , uhh , writing something for Jake .
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , well , speaking of Jake .
Did he explain everything to you ?
Finn : Yyeah .
Princess Bubblegum : And you understand ?
Finn : &#91; Turns around &#93; Yeah , I understand .
Princess Bubblegum : Finn , sometimes you want someone and you &#91; puts hand on Finn &apos;s left knee &#93; want to kiss them , and be with them .
But you can &apos;t , because responsibility demands sacrifice .
Finn : &#91; Finn is angered , blushing and he retaliates &#93; What are you trying to say ? !
Princess Bubblegum : I &apos;m trying to say that you &apos;re a hero , Finn .
You &apos;re my hero .
So , I &apos;m glad you understand why you can &apos;t be with Flame Princess .
Finn : &#91; Still angered , stands up for himself and Flame Princess &#93; Grr ... Bubblegum !
I can &apos;t do this anymore !
Princess Bubblegum : What ?
Finn : Now you like me ? !
Princess Bubblegum : Finn , what are you talking about ?
Finn : What am I talking about ? !
&#91; Sighs and assumes &#93; PB , I was .... geh ... eh .. &#91; Blushes &#93; I was in love with you !
Okay ? !
And you didn &apos;t love me back !
Now I &apos;m ready to move on , and it &apos;s like ... rrmph ! !
You &apos;re gonna build me up all over again !
Well , I &apos;m done !
I &apos;m done .
&#91; Leaves Princess Bubblegum for herself &#93; Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Picks up a piece of crumpled paper and tries reading it , then quietly exclaims &#93; Oh , no !
&#91; Later at the Tree Fort , Jake is making and singing &quot; Bacon Pancakes &quot; &#93; &#91; Then Princess Bubblegum appears climbing up a ladder . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Finn !
Jake , where &apos;s Finn ?
Is he with Flame Princess ?
Jake : &#91; Taps the frying pan &#93; Back off , Bubblegum !
That &apos;s his &quot; man &apos;s biz . &quot;
Princess Bubblegum : Is he with her ? !
&#91; Shows the crumpled paper to Jake &#93; Or not ? !
Jake : &#91; Jake is angered and he retaliates &#93; You heartless monster !
Do you have any idea how much he &apos;s CRIED OVER YOU ?
Finn deserves to be happy , even if his blooping face gets burned off !
&#91; Picks up PANCAKE TOWER box &#93; You should be &#91; throws box to Princess Bubblegum &#93; ashamed !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum dodges the box &#93; You &apos;re SICK !
&#91; Points and blames Princess Bubblegum for everything &#93; Princess Bubblegum : What are you .. ?
This isn &apos;t about some &#91; crumbles the paper &#93; petty love triangle !
Flame Princess is physically unstable !
&#91; Explains &#93; Her elemental matrix can &apos;t handle extreme romance !
Glob , if Finn tries to kiss her , she &apos;ll burn so hot , she &apos;ll melt right through the planet &apos;s crust , down through the molten core , then she &apos;ll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside !
Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up ? !
Jake : &#91; Shocked and Gasps &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Will you take me to them ?
&#91; Jake turns around , shuts the burner , grabs Princess Bubblegum , grows huge , breaks the wall , and makes a run for it . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Faster !
&#91; Later , near Flame Princess &apos;s house &#93; Finn : &#91; Blushing while reciting his poem for Flame Princess . &#93;
Your wavelengths are my weakness , your emissions are what I &apos;ve been missing .
&#91; Then the poem is accidentally burnt by Flame Princess . &#93;
Finn and Flame Princess : &#91; Both giggle &#93; Flame Princess : Ahhh .
&#91; Then Finn and Flame Princess lean in to kiss each other . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : No !
&#91; Finn and Flame Princess kiss for the very first time , followed by a bright light from the instability of Flame Princess &apos;s elemental matrix , which throws Finn to the ground . &#93;
Finn : &#91; In pain , with serious burns around the lips &#93; Ohhhh-uh , Flame Princess !
&#91; Crawls to the melted hole &#93; &#91; Flame Princess continues to melt and fall through the Earth &apos;s crust . &#93;
Finn : FLAME PRINCESS !
Jake : &#91; Panting &#93; Finn !
Princess Bubblegum : Finn , there &apos;s no time !
You have to ... Jake : Are you alright ?
&#91; Finn grabs Jake &apos;s right arm , ties it around himself , and jumps into the hole after Flame Princess . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Finn !
Jake : &#91; Difficulty of handling Finn keeps increasing .
He slips and covers the entire hole . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Panting , then he hits ground .
The surrounding scene color changes from red to violet . &#93;
Ohhh-tsst .
Flame Princess !
Jake : &#91; In pain &#93; It &apos;s hot !
Princess Bubblegum : Wait , wait !
Don &apos;t move .
This is good !
If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds , the reaction will be deprived of oxygen .
&#91; Hushed voice &#93; She &apos;ll go out .
Jake : &#91; Still in pain &#93; Geh .. What about Finn ?
&#91; At the bottom of the hole &#93; Finn : Hey !
&#91; Struggling to breathe &#93; What &apos;s wrong ?
Please , say something .
&#91; Breathes twice &#93; Please ... &#91; breathes &#93; I need you ... &#91; breathes &#93; to be okay .
&#91; Takes a deep breath and gives Flame Princess air to save her . &#93;
&#91; Flame Princess burns again and regains consciousness . &#93;
&#91; Finn loses consciousness , with added burns to the right side of his face . &#93;
Flame Princess : Huh , ummm .
&#91; Gasps &#93; &#91; Jake pulls out both Finn and Flame Princess successfully . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Coughs &#93; Are you okay ?
Flame Princess : I &apos;m okay .
I &apos;m okay .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum struggles to get out of Jake &apos;s weight and gets a relief . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Sighs &#93; She &apos;s stabilized .
We &apos;re safe ... for now .
&#91; Then Finn discovers another way of kissing Flame Princess without getting hurt . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Blushes &#93; &#91; Kisses a rock . &#93;

Finn : Auh ...
I &apos;m not used , uh ... to running on all fours !
Oahh !
Jake : Ready to admit it &apos;s harder than it looks ?
Finn : I &apos;ll never admit anything to you .
Hey where &apos;d you go ?
&#91; Jake has shrunk down and stretches his leg to trip Finn &apos;s stilts &#93; Jake : Heh heh heh .
Finn : &#91; falling &#93; Whoa aoh oh !

Penny : &#91; falling back &#93; Please , don &apos;t steal anything from me !
Finn : Whoa !
We wouldn &apos;t do that .
We &apos;re heroes .
Jake : &#91; stretching his stomach to look like a face &#93; We want to turn your frown all the way around .
&#91; twisting the face he made on his stomach &#93; Penny : Ahh !
&#91; continues crying &#93; Finn : &#91; nudging him &#93; Jake !
Jake : I &apos;ll face the other way , but I &apos;m gonna keep doing this .
Finn : So what &apos;s wrong ?
Penny : Oh , it was terrible .
I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert , when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket !
Then ran into the city .
Finn : The city ?
Hag : ... of Thieves !
Jake : Oh boy .
Hag : Heed my warning boy : enter the city , and you &apos;ll come out a thief !
Finn : Never .

She falls over and the ruby is thrown into Mr.
Turtle &apos;s hands . &#93;
Finn : Don &apos;t steal , Mr.

Everyone steals from each other .
It &apos;s redoodoodiculous !
Finn : Penny !
Never say that !
Penny : Redoodoodiculous ?
Finn : No !
The whole thing you said .
About hopelessness .
&apos;Cause I &apos;m gonna get your basket back from whoever took it .
And then I &apos;m going to &#91; yells &#93; beat my purity into them !
Jake : And then I &apos;m gonna beat your purity outta them .
&#91; lightly punches Finn &#93; And then beat a sandwich into them !
&#91; grunts while throwing air punches &#93; And then beat them to the punch !
And then punch &apos; em !
Finn : We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny &apos;s flower basket !
Jake : Okay .
&#91; Finn and Jake start running towards Mr.
Turtle . &#93;
Finn : Hey turd-le ( turtle ) !
I &apos;m gonna kick your butt !
Also , have you seen this little girl &apos;s flower basket ?
Jake : You &apos;re going down , turtle !
&#91; Mr.
Turtle flies off by using fires coming out of him . &#93;
Jake : Woah !
I want jets !
&#91; Mr.
Turtle lands on a roof and Crossbow Guy steals the jewel from his crown . &#93;
Finn : Come back , Crossbow Guy !
&#91; Finn punches Mr.
Turtle .
When Crossbow Guy lands , Two-Headed Thief steals his crossbow . &#93;
Crossbow Guy : My crossbow !
Penny : Hey , my basket !
That &apos;s my basket !
Finn : Don &apos;t worry , Penny .
We &apos;ll get it right after I deal with this guy !
&#91; points to Crossbow Guy . &#93;
Stealing &apos;s wrong , doofus !
&#91; Crossbow Guy drops the jewel from Mr.
Turtle &apos;s crown . &#93;
Penny : &#91; laughs &#93; This is fun , Finn !
&#91; Finn whoops .
Finn , Jake , and Penny fly off after the Two-Headed Thief .
Wizard Thief is shown cutting off one of Two-Headed Thief &apos;s heads and stealing Penny &apos;s basket . &#93;

Two-Headed Thief Head 2 : My body !
&#91; The Cyclops confronts the Wizard Thief &#93; Cyclops : I &apos;m gonna steal your flower basket , wizard !

&#91; Goblin Thief # 1 steals the flower basket and Phil &apos;s glasses . &#93;
Phil : My glasses !
&#91; Jake punches Phil . &#93;
Finn : There it goes !
&#91; Goblin Thief # 1 laughs . &#93;
Finn : I will smite thee , goblin thief !
&#91; Goblin Thief # 1 is talking to Goblin Thief # 2 &#93; Goblin Thief # 1 : You stole that basket from me !
Goblin Thief # 2 : No I didn &apos;t !
&#91; Goblin Thief # 3 steals the basket from Goblin Thief # 2 &#93; Hey !
Gimme that !
I stole it first !
I &apos;ll use my sword on you !
&#91; Goblin Thief # 1 steals Goblin Thief # 2 &apos;s sword . &#93;

It &apos;s time to step into the purification chamber , son !

Goblin Thief # 7 steals the fishing rod from them .
Goblin Thief # 8 steals the fishing rod and basket from him , and Goblin Thief # 9 steals the basket from Goblin Thief # 8 .
Goblin Thief # 9 runs off while Finn , Jake and Penny run after him .
Suddenly , Goblin Thief # 9 does not have the basket .
Goblin Thief # 10 has stolen it from above . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasping for breath &#93; How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen ? !
&#91; grunts in frustration &#93; Jake : Hey !
We can steal a new one from that guy !
&#91; Jake points to a &apos; Baskets &amp; Boots &apos; store .
The owner is asleep . &#93;
He &apos;s got lots of flower baskets .
And boots !
I &apos;d like to steal me one of them pairs of boots , especially .
Finn : No , Jake .
We can &apos;t steal .
We have to stay pure !
Jake : &#91; reluctantly &#93; Okay .
Penny : I have an idea !
My mom used to tell me that there &apos;s a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city , and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower .
Maybe we &apos;d find my basket in his treasure chest !
Finn : That &apos;s a great idea , Penny !
Penny : There &apos;s one thing , though .
The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier .
Which magically keeps thieves out .
Finn : Have you forgotten ? !
We three ain &apos;t thieves !
We &apos;re pure !
Right , Jake ?
&#91; Finn turns to look at Jake , but he isn &apos;t there . &#93;
Jake ?
Jake : &#91; tiptoeing towards Baskets &amp; Boots and whispering &#93; Just gotta steal these boots ... Finn : Jake !
Jake : Huh ?
Baskets &amp; Boots owner : &#91; wakes up &#93; Hey !
Go away !
Finn : What are you doin &apos; , man ?
Jake : It &apos;s the city , it &apos;s getting to me .
Help me , Finn !
Finn : I &apos;m here for ya buddy .
&#91; hugs Jake &#93; Jake : Thank you Finn , thank you .
&#91; Jake then breaks away from Finn &apos;s arms running to the &apos; Baskets &amp; Boots &apos; store screaming . &#93;
Finn : &#91; running after Jake &#93; Nooo !
&#91; tackles him &#93; I won &apos;t let you become a thief !
&#91; puts something on Jake &apos;s hands &#93; Jake : Uh , what are these ?
&#91; show bells tied onto his hands &#93; Finn : Bells .
That way , I &apos;ll hear you if you try to steal again .
Jake : Oh .
Hmm .
&#91; shakes bells &#93; &#91; Scene switches to King of Thieves &apos; tower .
Finn , Penny , and Jake are walking up stairs to reach the top &#93; Penny : The King of Thieves &apos; tower is right up here .
Finn : Woah .
&#91; The tower is shown surrounded by a light blue aura . &#93;
You read to pass through , Penny ?
Penny : I &apos;m too afraid !
Is it okay if I wait out here ?
Finn : Sure .
C &apos;mon , let &apos;s go , Jake !
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Comin &apos; !
&#91; Jake is wearing a pair of red boots . &#93;
Finn : Jake , where &apos;d you get those boots ?
Jake : Huh , what ?
What boots ?
&#91; looks down &#93; Oh , no !
I stole !
The city !
It took advantage of me !
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; Jake , you &apos;re a thief now !
You won &apos;t be able to get in anymore !
Jake : Yes , I can .
&#91; runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back &#93; Oh .
&#91; chuckles &#93; Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; It &apos;s up to me , now .
Penny : Legend says you &apos;ll find the loot in the King of Thieves &apos; chest .
Good luck , Finn !
Oh , yeah , and that high window is the only entrance .
Finn : Hmm .
Alright , wish me luck !
Jake : She already did , man .
Finn : Oh , yeah .
Right .
&#91; passes through the barrier and starts to climb the tower while Jake cheers him on .
He reaches the window , only to find that there is a rope leading downward &#93; Great , now I gotta climb down ? !
&#91; floor starts to break &#93; Huh ?
&#91; The floor completely breaks and he falls down and screams , eventually hitting a spider-web at the bottom .
He sees the remains of the King of Thieves . &#93;
The King of Thieves !
&#91; to the corpse &#93; Sorry to trespass , I just ...
Uh , hello ?
&#91; sees a treasure chest &#93; The chest !
In it &apos;s in his chest !
Thanks !
&#91; A rat crawls out of the King &apos;s eye in his skull .
Finn runs off screaming . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to outside , where Jake and Penny are waiting . &#93;
Jake : You see , if you have too much earwax , you won &apos;t be able to hear anymore .
Finn : &#91; exiting the tower &#93; I got it , guys !
Penny : The chest !
Gimme that !
&#91; grabs the chest from Finn &#93; Finn : Huh ?
&#91; Penny puts the chest down .
She pulls out a black crooked knife . &#93;
Jake : Woah , woah , woah .
Easy , kid .
&#91; Penny opens the chest .
Inside the chest are gold coins , jewels , a dagger and a Game Boy .
She laughs maniacally . &#93;
Finn : What ? !
&#91; stammering &#93; Is you basket under all that gold ?
Penny : Of course it &apos;s not !
I set you up to steal this chest of gold !
I couldn &apos;t get past the barrier &apos; cause I &apos;m a thief !
Finn : But you &apos;re just a cute little girl !
Penny : And , I &apos;m a thief !
Finn : Well , if this isn &apos;t yours , I &apos;m gonna return it right now !
&#91; closes the lid and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back &#93; Huh ?
&#91; puts hand and body against barrier , to no avail &#93; Why can &apos;t I ... ?
Penny : Because you stole something in the city !
Now you &apos;re a thief !
Finn : No !
&#91; yells &#93; No ! ! !
What have I done ? !
What have I become ? !
Penny : You &apos;ve become a thief , stupid !
&#91; runs away with chest and laughs &#93; Finn : &#91; looks at hands &#93; My hands .
They &apos;re all dirty .
Covered in the dust of a criminal act !
I &apos;m a thief !
&#91; Suddenly , laughing is heard .
Jake looks around for the source .
Underneath him , the floor rises up and the Hag emerges . &#93;
Hag : Oh , what did I tell you , boy ?
This city will get you , no matter how pure you think you are !
&#91; laughs &#93; I was right .
Jake : Hey , that &apos;s enough from you , Hag !
&#91; puts feet around Hag &apos;s face and throws her away &#93; &#91; walks over to Finn &#93; Finn ?
Finn : Don &apos;t touch me !
I &apos;m impure , man !
Unfit to be a hero !
Unfit to be your friend .
Jake : Come on , Finn , keep it together !
Finn : No , Jake .
This is a one-way path , down a jacked-up road .
And I gotta walk it ... alone .
Jake : I &apos;m not gonna leave you alone in the city .
You &apos;re my buddy .
Besides , I stole these boots .
These super-big style boots .
So I &apos;m just as dirty as you are , Finn .
We gotta walk this filthy path together !
Finn : Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny .
Jake : Cowabunga !
&#91; stretches into a cape for Finn &#93; Finn : Cowabunga , indeed .
&#91; Finn and Jake start hopping over rooftops and into the house of the Short Goblin .
They steal Crossbow Guy &apos;s crossbow from him and exit .
They go into a different house with a crocodile in it and steal two swords .
They also go into a house where a horse is showering .
They steal the soap it was using and it whinnies .
Scene changes to tent where Penny lives . &#93;
Penny : &#91; inspecting jewel from chest &#93; Mmm .
Yes .
Yeah .
&#91; Finn &apos;s shadow can be seen on the tent .
A twig is heard snapping . &#93;
Wha ?
Is someone there ? !
&#91; Finn &apos;s shadow goes away and Penny returns to her inspecting .
Finn and Jake &apos;s head comes down from the top of the tent and Finn quietly says &quot; Penny , &quot; who turns around at the sound of her name .
She pulls her black crooked knife out . &#93;
Finn : &#91; off-screen &#93; It &apos;s me , Penny .
The hero whose purity you stole !
And I &apos;m here to enact my revenge upon you !
&#91; Jake flies over Penny , who squeals .
Finn lands on the other side of the tent . &#93;
Jake : Hi , Penny .
Penny : Finn , please don &apos;t punch my lights out !
I &apos;m just a poor , homeless baby girl .
Finn : I trusted you , Penny .
You made me steal .
And you took my purity .
You ruined me !
Penny : I &apos;m sorry , Finn .
&#91; reaches into a nearby bag &#93; Let me give you some uh , gems , or some gold , or uh , have some &#91; pulls out knife &#93; knife in your neck !
&#91; Penny jumps at Finn &#93; Jake : Watch out , Finn !
&#91; shoots boots at Penny , making her drop the knife and fall down &#93; Finn : Thanks , dude .
Jake : Yeah , dude .
Penny : You may have soiled my purity , but I think you can still come out clean .
&#91; holds out soap &#93; C &apos;mon , Jake !
&#91; Jake laughs and throws water over Penny while Finn cleans her &#93; Penny : No !
No !
&#91; Bubbles fill the screen and once they disappear , Finn , Jake , and Penny are all clean . &#93;
Jake : Nice work , dude .
Finn : She &apos;s purified !
Penny : &#91; sparkles &#93; I feel ... clean !
Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone !
Thank you F and J !
I haven &apos;t felt like this since I was young !
Finn : You &apos;re welcome .
Jake : Woah , dude !
&#91; rubs Finn , making squeaky sounds &#93; The soap got on us , too !
Finn : We &apos;re clean !
Finn and Jake : Yes !
&#91; fist pounds &#93; Finn : This good deed we did has purified us once again .
We &apos;re virgin islands !
&#91; Cherubs fly from off-screen , playing a trumpet and a harp .
They steal the swords from Finn that he stole earlier . &#93;
Penny : Finn , thanks for the second chance to live a pure life .
Finn : And you know what that means , Penny .
No more stealing !
&#91; winks &#93; Penny : Never again .
Finn : Well , I think it &apos;s time for us to get the math out of here .
Penny : &#91; jumps up and gives Finn a hug &#93; I &apos;m going to miss you , Finn !
Finn : I &apos;ll miss you , too .
Penny : &#91; exiting the tent &#93; G &apos;bye !
Jake : Woah , dude .
Why are you naked ?
&#91; Finn is shown wearing nothing but his pack and underpants . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasps in shock &#93; PENNY !
&#91; The episode opens at night .
Finn is battling monsters with a golden sword in a Minecraft-style world . &#93;
Finn : You sad mobs .
Y &apos;all wish you had this sweet dang bucket !
&#91; A skeleton shoots the bucket Finn is holding and he gasps before charging towards the monsters . &#93;
Yaaaah !
&#91; He slays a spider and his sword breaks . &#93;
Aah !
It &apos;s mine time !
&#91; He pulls a pickaxe out of his backpack and uses it to slay a skeleton . &#93;
Get beat dead-meat !
&#91; The pickaxe also breaks while he is using it to attack a zombie . &#93;
My tool !
Die !
&#91; He slays the zombie using the bucket , and it drops a carrot . &#93;
Oh , a li &apos;l zombie carrot .
&#91; He puts the carrot in his mouth and speaks with his mouth full . &#93;
I should &apos;ve washed it .
&#91; Finn walks to a stream and collects some water in the bucket , which he places full into his backpack .
A sheep splashes down a nearby waterfall and bleats .
Finn towers up a cliff using dirt blocks .
The sun rises behind him and monsters burn away in the distance .
Finn inhales and exhales the morning air .
He walks past various other animals .
A cow moos and a wolf barks .
Finally , he comes across Lemongrab , who is groaning in a field as he looks down at a lemon he is holding . &#93;
Lemongrab : Impertinence .
&#91; He shakes the lemon and drops it onto the ground . &#93;
Nyah !
Grow !
Grooow !
&#91; Finn arrives at the Tree House .
He rides a minecart into the mine below , where Jake is digging away at the walls with a pickaxe .
Jake strikes the wall and a blue glow appears . &#93;
Jake : Aha !
&#91; He takes the diamond and places it alongside a few others in a minecart . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Crashing his minecart into the one containing Jake &apos;s diamonds . &#93;
Head &apos;s up !
Oof .
Jake : Oof .
Finn : I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for .
&#91; He hands Jake the bucket . &#93;
Jake : Thanks , dude .
Finn : Whatcha doing down here anyways ?
Jake : Digging up diamonds for a little project .
Finn : I &apos;ll help , buddy .
&#91; A montage shows the minecart being filled to the brim with diamonds as the two of them mine . &#93;
Jake : Whew .
&#91; Finn and Jake give each other a thumbs up .
Jake wheels the diamonds towards a flow of lava .
He takes one and polishes it with his wrist .
Finn watches from nearby .
Then , without warning , he throws a diamond into the lava . &#93;
Jake : Hehe .
&#91; He begins throwing away more diamonds . &#93;
Vanilla no mods !
Vanilla no mods !
Vanilla no mods !
Vanilla no mods !
Finn : What the heck man ? !
&#91; Jake shrugs . &#93;
It &apos;s such a senseless waste .
Jake : Au contraire , mon friend .
I &apos;m extremely senseful .
You see this bucket of water ?
It &apos;s in case I fall in the lava and catch fire .
Finn : You could make something really good with these .
Like a better sword for your best bro .
Jake : Or &#91; throws more diamonds &#93; .
Finn : &#91; Picks up a diamond . &#93;
I &apos;m gonna take this shiny boy , and show you the way .
Jake : You do you , buddy .
Finn : I &apos;m sure you &apos;d get it if you just took a moment to think about it .
&#91; He raises his voice as he takes a piston elevator back up to the surface . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Indifferently &#93; Uh huh .
&#91; The camera pans up to show Lumpy Space Princess , Ice King , Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life-Giving , Gunter , and a living block of TNT hanging out in a cave . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Look guys , it was totally epic .
I wrecked the library &apos;s glass ceiling like , NBD , then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies .
Gunter : &#91; Dismissively &#93; Wenk wenk .
Live-Giving Magus : That &apos;s small potaters .
We should do something big .
I got a storage full of live dynamite .
&#91; He pats the life-given TNT and it barks like a dog . &#93;
Ice King : Hey .
We should grief Finn and Jake .
We could plant a tree on the Tree House !
Huh .. ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugh .
It &apos;s totally obvious you &apos;ve never griefed anybody .
Ice King : That &apos;s only technically true .
And not to be &quot; that guy &quot; , but it &apos;s actually &#91; air quotes &#93; &quot; aggrieved &quot; .
Lumpy Space Princess : You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang !
Only cool mean girls allowed !
Ice King : I &apos;m ice-cool LSP .
Lumpy Space Princess : No !
Call me by my gang name !
Ice King : Okay .
Gravel Gal .
&#91; The scene changes .
Finn is walking through a field .
He sighs and takes out the diamond .
He walks past Lemongrab again . &#93;
Lemongrab : Hnnngh .
Grooooow !
&#91; Finn hands him a shovel . &#93;
Oh .
Yes , of course .
&#91; He digs a hole and drops the lemon into it with a grunt , then starts hitting it with the shovel . &#93;
Grow .
No grooooowth !
&#91; Marceline , Bubblegum , and a group of skeletons are building a windmill nearby .
Marceline stretches , then laughs evilly as she summons lightning .
Three new skeletons emerge from the ground . &#93;
Marceline : Who here loves windmills ?
&#91; One of the skeletons raises their hand and Marceline high fives them . &#93;
Haha , alright .
Now get to work .
Finn : Yo , Marcy .
That &apos;s a real nice windmill .
Marceline : Thanks .
When it &apos;s done , I &apos;m gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal .
Skeleton : What &apos;s that , boss ?
Marceline : Keep working , buddy .
So , whatcha got there ?
Finn : A little lump destined for something big .
Marceline : Just like your butt .
Hah !
Finn : Good one .
But no .
I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake .
Marceline : Well I recommend building a windmill .
Finn : A diamond windmill .
Princess Bubblegum : No , that &apos;s silly .
You need something more sciencey .
&#91; Finn throws her the diamond and she takes it over to a crafting table . &#93;
Diamond , lapis , some gunpowder , juicy nugget , add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There !
&#91; She produces a firework rocket . &#93;
I &apos;m positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty , and its false sense of purpose .
Finn : &#91; Takes the firework and gestures for a high five . &#93;
Up top .
&#91; Before Bubblegum can return the high five , Lemongrab screams from off-screen . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : What ?
Aw blocks .
&#91; Lemongrab is repeatedly hitting the lemon with the shovel and grunting . &#93;
Finn : He &apos;s been at it all day .
Princess Bubblegum : I should help him .
See you later Finn .
Finn : Alright .
M &apos;ladies .
&#91; He bows to Marceline and Bubblegum . &#93;
M &apos;lemon .
&#91; He bows to Lemongrab and exits . &#93;
Lemongrab : Nyarg !
&#91; He throws away the shovel . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Hey , it &apos;s okay buddy .
Lemongrab : Can &apos;t ... tree !
Princess Bubblegum : You can &apos;t just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding .
Marceline : Yeah you can .
Lemongrab : What ?
Princess Bubblegum : This is an oak sapling .
This is a jungle sapling .
&#91; She hands him the saplings . &#93; .
And this ... &#91; She drops a lot of bone meal at his feet . &#93;
This is a lot of bone meal .
Marceline : Courtesy of Marceline the Bone Meal Queen .
Princess Bubblegum : Now we don &apos;t actually need the bone meal but it &apos;ll help speed things up , and as for the space requirements on the ground , it depends ... &#91; She is drowned out by Lemongrab screeching joyfully . &#93;
&#91; The scene changes .
Tree Trunks and Mr.
Pig are playing cards in their cabin . &#93;
Tree Trunks : How many aces do you have ?
Mr.
Pig : I got five .
Tree Trunks : Oh shoot , I only got two .
&#91; Finn pokes his head in through a window . &#93;
Finn : Hey y &apos;all .
&#91; He drops into the room . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Finn !
Finn : I was just passing through , but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies .
Tree Trunks : Say no more .
&#91; She walks to the oven , humming to herself , and removes a baking tray that resembles a crafting grid .
She places onto it the ingredients for a pumpkin pie . &#93;
Finn : I &apos;m no expert , but that kinda looks like a pumpkin .
Tree Trunks : &#91; Puts the ingredients in the oven . &#93;
Sorry about that .
I &apos;m just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins .
Too many pumpkins .
&#91; She gives Finn a pumpkin and he places it in his bag .
The oven dings and Tree Trunks removes the finished pie . &#93;
Hot pie .
Finn : &#91; Takes the pie and sniffs it deeply before putting it in his backpack . &#93;
Uh , this might sound a bit weird but I &apos;m kinda tired and it &apos;s a long way home ... Tree Trunks : Say no more .
&#91; They both turn to Mr.
Pig . &#93;
Mr.
Pig : Fine .
&#91; Outside , Tree Trunks saddles Mr.
Pig , then Finn crafts a carrot on a stick and mounts him . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Bye bye boys .
&#91; Mr.
Pig bucks and winnies . &#93;
Finn : Whoa !
Mr.
Pig : &#91; Reluctantly chasing the carrot on a stick . &#93;
You know you could just tell me where to go .
&#91; Finn ignores him .
The sky turns orange as the sun begins to set .
Mr.
Pig is getting tired and is panting .
An enderman carrying a block of snow steps onto the path in front of them . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Whispering and turning his face away . &#93;
Dude , stop .
Enderman .
Don &apos;t look at it .
It will- Mr.
Pig : What the heck is that ? !
&#91; The enderman turns and screeches at them , angered . &#93;
Finn : Oh Glob .
&#91; The enderman drops the snow block and begins teleporting towards them menacingly .
They both scream and Mr.
Pig bucks Finn off before running away . &#93;
Finn : Hey !
Mr.
Pig : Wee wee wee !
Wee wee wee !
Wee wee wee !
Finn : Enderman !
Fight me !
&#91; He pulls out the pumpkin pie and realizes he doesn &apos;t have a weapon . &#93;
Oh no .
&#91; As the enderman rushes towards him , Finn closes his eyes and looks down at the ground .
This causes the enderman to stop just in front of him . &#93;
Finn : So , uh ... Do you have , like , another job , or is this what you do full time ?
I saw you carrying that block back there .
You into building stuff ?
&#91; Peppermint Butler enters holding an emerald block , then covers his eyes and runs away after spotting the enderman . &#93;
Finn : I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else .
&#91; It begins to rain .
The scene changes to show Lemongrab piling bone meal onto the saplings .
It suddenly grows into a small tree . &#93;
Lemongrab : Who-aah ?
Mhmm , mhmm , mhmm .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum is sat on top of the finished windmill . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Whew .
Good work .
Let &apos;s call it a day .
&#91; The skeletons return to the ground and Marceline flies up to join her on the roof .
She hands her an apple and they both eat .
Darkness falls and the moon rises .
Finn is still trapped with the enderman just in front of him .
He is sweating profusely and whistling nervously .
Lumpy Space Princess is sleeping in a dirt shelter nearby . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Muttering in her sleep &#93; Meh .
Beh .
Beans ?
Beans .
&#91; She wakes up . &#93;
That noise .
&#91; She heads over to Finn . &#93;
Finn , I &apos;m trying to sleep !
Finn : &#91; Whispering &#93; Hey LSP .
Don &apos;t be scared .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Speaking at regular volume &#93; What are you even doing , just looking at this guy &apos;s toes ?
Finn : Yeah , I have to .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh .
I don &apos;t get it .
Does this guy even have toes ?
Are those his toes ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever even seen a toe , come to think of it .
What am I even talking about ?
&#91; The enderman gets so bored of Lumpy Space Princess &apos; rambling that they leave . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Suddenly hugs Lumpy Space Princess &#93; Thank you I &apos;ve been stuck here so long !
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Blushing &#93; Haha .
Sure ... Ew !
You &apos;re all smelly and wet .
Get out of here !
Finn : Fair enough .
&#91; He exits . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Quietly &#93; But come back after you &apos;ve showered .
&#91; Ice King flies up to Finn while he &apos;s walking and steals the pumpkin out of his bag . &#93;
Ice King : Yoink .
&#91; Laughs maniacally . &#93;
Finn : Thief !
Ice King : You got griefed !
&#91; He runs into the enderman with a grunt .
It turns around and screeches at him .
Ice King screams , places the pumpkin on his head , and runs away , pursued by the enderman .
He yells in a muffled voice . &#93;
I &apos;m not looking at you !
I &apos;m not looking !
&#91; The sun rises the next morning .
A sheep gets up from where Lemongrab has been using it as a pillow and he wakes up . &#93;
Lemongrab : &#91; Still half asleep &#93; Good morning .
How dare you .
&#91; With an exclamation of surprise , he notices that the tree has grown , and thinks he sees lemons growing in its leaves . &#93;
Lemon seed babies !
&#91; Clapping gleefully &#93; Oh , you shall be my true heirs .
&#91; He knocks one of them down , revealing that it is in fact an apple . &#93;
What ? !
A apple ?
&#91; sic &#93; Unacceptable !
UNACCEPTABLE !
&#91; Tree Trunks enters , carrying a sword and a basket . &#93;
Tree Trunks : Oh , gracious .
&#91; She begins knocking down apples with the sword into the basket . &#93;
Good job , Lemon-crab .
&#91; She exits . &#93;
Lemongrab : &#91; Quietly &#93; Pie me .
Pie me for my apples .
&#91; The scene changes .
Jake is kicking diamonds around in the mine .
He sniffs the air . &#93;
Jake : Pie .
&#91; Finn enters and hands him the pie . &#93;
Finn : You won &apos;t believe what I went though to get this .
Jake : Oh yeah , you were gonna make something right ?
&#91; They both begin eating the pie . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Sees that Jake has organised the diamonds into a neat pattern . &#93;
Whoa !
You did it !
You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected .
&#91; Jake pushes all of the diamonds into the lava at once , destroying the pattern . &#93;
Finn : D &apos;aw come on !
Diamonds are so hard to get !
&#91; Jake shrugs . &#93;
Oh , duh .
Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it .
It &apos;s a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again .
&#91; He lights the firework rocket and it explodes anticlimactically on the ceiling of the mine .
A flow of lava falls from where it exploded . &#93;
That was supposed to be fireworks .
Jake : I like this better .
&#91; During the credits sequence , a montage is shown .
Marceline and Princess Bubblegum high five having completed the windmill .
Tree Trunks and Mr.
Pig are left with an excess of pumpkin pies .
Lemongrab chops down the apple tree .
Ice King builds a dirt shelter while zombies surround him .
The enderman places the pumpkin on top of the snow blocks they were carrying earlier , creating a snow golem .
The enderman and the snow golem hold hands . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; to Finn and Jake &#93; Alright , guys .
Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole .
I &apos;ve gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk .
Finn : You got it , Princess .
Jake : Whatever you want , mama .
Princess Bubblegum : Bubblegum , away ! !
&#91; Finn nails a sign with a sledgehammer , and Jake uses his fists as hammers &#93; Jake : Ow .
Ow .
Ow .
Finn : There .
That &apos;s the last sign , Jake .
Now no one will go down this hole , ever .
Probably a lot of dangerous , awesome stuff down this hole .
I better go take a look .
&#91; Finn jumps down the hole , and Jake fishes him out using his arm as a fishing pole and line &#93; Jake : Don &apos;t , dude .
For you see , that &apos;s the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye !
Finn : Whoa .
Jake : Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon .
Man , we shouldn &apos;t even be talkin &apos; about it , &apos; cause it &apos;s lunch time .
&#91; holds out picnic equipment &#93; &#91; A &quot; LUNCH TIME &quot; logo pops up &#93; Finn : The crystal eye .
I wanna meet this dungeon .
Jake : Maybe after lunch .
Finn : Eh , I &apos;ll skip lunch .
Just catch up with me when you are finished .
Jake : * Pfft * Yeah , right .
Finn : What ?
Jake : Without the aid of my magnificent powers ... &#91; shapes hand into bottle opener and opens a bottle of water &#93; ... Huh ?
Huh ?
You &apos;d get killed down there .
Finn : Hey !
I can do things without you !
You wanna bet I can &apos;t ?
Jake : Nope .
Come get your sandwich .
&#91; using Finn &apos;s sandwich as a puppet &#93; Listen to Jake , Finn .
He only wants what &apos;s best for-- &#91; Jake bites Finn &apos;s sandwich &#93; &#91; using sandwich puppet , muffled &#93; Ahh !
Help me !
Ahh !
Come put her out of her misery , dude !
Finn : We are betting !
I bet that I &apos;ll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes .
&#91; quickly &#93; Ready set go !
&#91; jumps down hole &#93; Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; I better go after him .
Jake &#91; as sandwich puppet &#93; : No , Jake !
Stay here , with me ... Jake : Oh , my ... &#91; makes out with the sandwich &#93; &#91; scene switches to inside the dungeon . &#93;
Finn : Dungeons !
Chambers !
Woah .
&#91; Sees bugbears everywhere &#93; Evil creatures !
&#91; laughs as monsters chase him &#93; Treasure chests !
&#91; treasure chest is actually a mimic monster , Finn laughs , jumps away as the creature tries to punch him , then the creature vomits gold , coins , doubloons , and rings and rubies &#93; Finn : Doorways !
&#91; floorboards try to close on him &#93; Traps !
&#91; Long jumps out of trap &#93; I &apos;m in my elemeeeeeeeeent ! !
&#91; Lands in chamber , sees a kitten &apos;s head sticking out of a black cave entrance &#93; Finn : Aww !
&#91; cat head turns upside down and ominously meows &#93; Finn : &#91; freaked out &#93; Oh ?
&#91; A demonic cat with a kitten for a tongue comes out , and sucks his tongue back in his mouth &#93; Finn : Whoa !
Somebody come pick up your freaky cat .
Demon Cat : Greetings , Frank the Human Boy .
Finn : How did you almost know my name ? !
Demon Cat : I have approximate knowledge of many things .
For instance , I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs .
&#91; circles Finn &#93; Finn : Huh , yeah right .
That sounds like idiot talk !
Demon Cat : You &apos;re trespassing on my dungeon , manling .
And I am the thing ... &#91; brandishes claws &#93; ... you should be afraid of .
Finn : You can &apos;t hurt me !
I &apos;m a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye !
Demon Cat : I &apos;m going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat .
Finn : Unzip this !
&#91; Does an armpit-fart , jumps back &#93; &#91; the Demon Cat leaps at him &#93; Finn : Bleep !
&#91; Demon Cat holds him down , and fiendishly bites at him &#93; OOF !
&#91; Finn punches him , the Demon Cat &apos;s eyes fill up with blood &#93; Demon Cat : Now , you DIE ! !
&#91; Leaps at Finn , and tears up his clothes , then stops &#93; Demon Cat : Wait a minute .
&#91; Sniffs twice &#93; Is that dog smell ? !
You ... you have a dog with you ?
I &apos;m outta here !
&#91; Runs away &#93; Finn : Yeah , right !
Good excuse !
Slaps , that cat was kicking my buns !
And it might have finished my buns if it weren &apos;t for Jake &apos;s stank .
Dang it , Jake !
I &apos;ll get that crystal eye on my own !
With my own odors .
&#91; walks by 3 different doors &#93; Hmm , no to skeletal remains door .
&#91; Sees a door that is a monsters mouth , Finn kicks in a skeleton and a trap closes on it &#93; No to giant monster mouth door .
&#91; sees key door &#93; Oh !
Giant key door it is !
&#91; Tries to open , but it &apos;s locked &#93; Finn : If Jake was here , he could stretch his hand into a key and open it .
&#91; shapes his hand like a key &#93; Yeah !
Key hand !
&#91; tries to open the door , but bruises his hand &#93; Ouch !
&#91; notices a green glow coming from a hatch &#93; Hey !
What the jug is that ?
&#91; Crawls in &#93; Finn : Oh , sweet , the key !
&#91; Finn sings the Key Song &#93; &#91; Reaches for key , which is inside a gelatinous green jelly cube &#93; Finn : Ew , jelly cube ? !
&#91; Tries to get the key but almost gets sucked in &#93; Come on !
Give it to me !
Don &apos;t flaunt it if you &apos;re not gonna give it up !
&#91; Screaming , falls out of the cube &#93; I &apos;ll never get that crystal eye !
No .
No , I just gotta stay pumped .
&#91; starts dancing , and singing &#93; Pump it up , pump it up !
Whoo !
Whoo !
Shake it !
Shake it !
Ahh !
&#91; Falls through the floor , lands in a waterfall chamber &#93; Steady , Finn .
This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it .
&#91; Jumps onto the floor &#93; Bucket Knight : Halt !
Come no further adventurer , for you see none can defeat ... the Bucket Knight !
&#91; He appears to be very small &#93; Finn : Okay , then I won &apos;t fight you .
Bucket Knight : No !
You must challenge me to-- &#91; Finn interrupts him &#93; Finn : Hey cutie , do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here ?
Bucket Knight : Yes , it &apos;s through that door over there , but-- &#91; Finn runs past him &#93; Finn : Thanks !
Bucket Knight : Hey !
You can &apos;t pass through that door with out battling me !
Finn : Yes , I can .
Because I &apos;m huge compared to you .
Bucket Knight : &#91; to himself &#93; Just add water and ... &#91; Pours water on himself &#93; ... exponential growth !
Finn : Aw , buckets .
Bucket Knight : Now , activate thine own powers , and we shall engage in thrilling single combat !
Finn : &#91; nervously &#93; Heh , thing is ...
I don &apos;t really ... have any powers .
Bucket Knight : &#91; smiles &#93; I see ... &#91; Gets chased by Bucket Knight &#93; Finn : AAAAH ! !
Dang it , Jake wouldn &apos;t be running !
He &apos;d grow all big , and sock you right in the nose hole !
&#91; Bucket Knight kicks the gorund , which it &apos;s vibration sends Finn flying &#93; Aw , nutzoids !
&#91; tries to run away , but Bucket Knight slides on the ground , causing Finn to once again , go flying &#93; Come on !
All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet !
&#91; jumps up , but Bucket Knight punches him far , bruising him really badly &#93; Finn : Oww ...
I rode the knuckle train ?
But ...
I ...
I &apos;m in my element .
&#91; Runs away and finally gets to the door , but the Bucket Knight is right behind him .
Before he could hit Finn , Finn jumps through the door &#93; Finn : AHHHHH ! ! ! !
Ow !
OW !
Ow !
OW !
Ow !
Uhh !
That ... sucked .
&#91; Takes a deep breath &#93; Alright , Finn , you &apos;re in a heavy pickle here .
You don &apos;t have Jake , and you &apos;re on your own .
But you can still handle this .
You can still get that crystal eye !
&#91; The Demon Cat is awake and crawls on a ledge an sees Finn &#93; Demon Cat : Hey , my dinner is back .
And your dog isn &apos;t with you !
That &apos;s what you said , right ?
Jack the Dog is not &quot; accompanying &quot; you ?
Finn : You mean Jake ?
Demon Cat : Jake , Jack , whatever .
He &apos;s not here , which means I &apos;m going to rip your heart out .
&#91; Chases Finn &#93; Finn : Crud , crud , crud , crud , crud !
Demon Cat : You can &apos;t hide from me , Jim .
I know almost everything , remember ?
I know exactly where you might be , Jim .
I &apos;m about to pounce on you .
&#91; Finn sits behind a rock pillar , nervous and scared &#93; Demon Cat : One ... two ... three !
&#91; jumps behind a rock &#93; Aw , man !
I thought you &apos;d be behind this rock .
Hmm ... &#91; sniffs twice &#93; Alright .
I know where you are now !
And I &apos;m about to pounce again !
&#91; Finn gets more scared &#93; One ... two ... three !
&#91; jumps behind another rock &#93; Aw , man !
Well , there &apos;s only a few more places to look .
Finn : Oh , Jake ...
I &apos;m such a fool .
A silly , silly fool .
&#91; a hand touches his mouth &#93; Who the heck-- ? !
Guardian Angel : Hey , it &apos;s okay .
Shh , I &apos;m your guardian angel , Finn .
I &apos;m here to save you .
Finn : Re ... really ?
Guardian Angel : Mmm-hm .
Come here , let the angel pick you up .
Finn : Okay .
&#91; Flies away with the angel , laughs &#93; This is radical .
Guardian Angel : Are you comfortable ?
Would you like some snacks ?
Finn : I &apos;m fine , thank you .
Guardian Angel : Here , let me clean you up , and mend your clothes .
&#91; Casts healing magic to clean up Finn and fix his clothes &#93; Finn : Ha ha ha ha ha !
Guardian Angel : I &apos;m taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye .... Finn : Aww , yeah !
Guardian Angel : ... where I &apos;m going to cook you and eat your flesh .
Finn : Wow ...
Wait !
What ? ? !
Guardian Angel : Trust in your &#91; The &quot; angel &quot; shows her true colors as her face misshapens into a hideous form , and a raspy voice &#93; guardian angel !
Finn : Put me down , lady !
Guardian Angel : As you wish .
&#91; Drops Finn in a cage full of soup and ingredients &#93; Finn : Man , everybody wants to eat me up .
It &apos;s probably &apos; cause I &apos;m so sweet .
Guardian Angel : Now for little kid soup .
&#91; Lights a fire &#93; The secret is a low flame over a long period .
Finn : That &apos;s Jake &apos;s secret , too .
I sure hope he saves me .
Guardian Angel : &#91; Flies away with beautiful face &#93; I will save thee , Finn .
Finn : Lady , you are sick !
Oh , Jake .
Jake : What ?
Finn : Jake !
Jake : Finn !
Finn : What are you doing here ? !
Jake : I was looking for you , knucklehead !
I was so worried , that right after lunch , I plunged into the dungeon after you .
Jake : Strangest thing , though , I kept runnin &apos; into obstacles .
&#91; Flashback begins &#93; Reaper : Choose your dueling weapon !
Jake : Uh ...
I choose ... sandwich !
&#91; He grabs his sandwich and fights with the reaper who simply cuts through it with a sword &#93; Jake : &#91; voiceover &#93; The challenges were impossible for me .
&#91; Goblin King challenges Jake to spitting their spit the farthest and laughs when Jake throws a pathetic spit &#93; &#91; A monster makes Jake chase a laser pointer , which leads Jake to bump into a wall &#93; Jake : &#91; voiceover &#93; But you would have blown right through .
I kept thinking to myself , &quot; What would Finn do ? &quot;
Just ... eh , frustrating .
Know what I mean ?
Finn : Yeah ...
I think I do .
&#91; Both chuckle , there &apos;s a moment of silence &#93; &#91; A &quot; NEWFOUND RESPECT &quot; logo pops up as they awkwardly handshake &#93; Finn : Now let &apos;s find a way out of this cage .
Jake : I &apos;ll get us out with Key Hand !
&#91; forms a Key Hand &#93; Finn : I really don &apos;t see any key holes on this cage .
Jake : Not a problem , man .
Lock Hand !
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; I &apos;ll get us out of here , with carrot hand !
&#91; takes a carrot and lights it on fire , and gives it to Jake .
Jake sets the cage &apos;s rope on fire , and it drops on the Guardian Angel , killing her &#93; Jake : Alright , man .
Let &apos;s go !
We &apos;ve still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet !
Finn : Wait !
You &apos;d help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you ?
Jake : Just hop on my powdered doughnut , boy !
Finn : Cling !
&#91; Finn laughs , and Jake carries him to the chamber of the crystal eye &#93; Jake : Alright , man .
Let &apos;s give this crystal eye the old friendship lift .
Finn : Okay .
Both : Friendship , go !
&#91; Demonic Eye Creatures fly out and Finn and Jake try to kill them , but they melt their weapons &#93; Finn : If I die , I &apos;ll have died with my best friend !
Jake : Me , too !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum flies in on her swan , angry &#93; Princess Bubblegum : Get on my swan !
&#91; Finn and Jake hop on her swan , which kills all the eye creatures with laser eyes &#93; Princess Bubblegum : I hope you learned a lesson from all this !
Both : Uh , we learned that working together is better .
Heh , whatever .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum growls &#93; Jake : &#91; whispers to Finn &#93; Looks like that &apos;s not the answer she wanted .
Finn : Uhh ...
I learned that you &apos;re a very ... intelligent princess ?
Princess Bubblegum : You &apos;re darn right I am .
Princess Bubblegum , away ! !
&#91; The three break out of the dungeon riding the swan .
&quot; ADVENTURE TIME &quot; logo pops up just as the episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn and Jake walking down a path in a forest . &#93;
Finn : What ... is the meaning of &quot; soup &quot; ?
Jake : What ?
I don &apos;t know .
What &apos;s with all the weird quest — ?
Finn : What ... is the meaning of &quot; spoon &quot; ?
Jake : Shoot , man , are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess ?
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s okay if you are .
Finn : Naw , that &apos;s all fine .
I just been feeling kind of ... gray , is all .
Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately .
Not a lot of instructions forthcoming , y &apos;know ?
Jake : Yeah , well , sounds like you &apos;re sad .
Listen , Finn , girls is like horses .
When you fall down , it &apos;s important that you get right back on again — on a different horse .
And there &apos;s a lot of fish in the sea .
A lot of fish .
A penny saved is a penny earned .
Finn : Yeah , I-I guess .
Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle .
Jake : Yeah , man , yeah !
Finn : Or , like , if you mess up , you could get really hurt forever , or hurt someone you really care about .
Jake : Eh , well , I suppose .
Anyway , I hope this mystery cave we &apos;re looking for is as weird as Flambo &apos;s brother says it is .
Maybe that &apos;ll snap you out of the — &#91; stops walking &#93; Whoa !
What ? !
&#91; He walks up to a train , which is passing by on its tracks . &#93;
Jake : What &apos;s this train all about ?
No one said nothing about no train in the way !
Finn : Relax , buddy .
We &apos;ll just cross after it passes .
No big thing , really .
Jake : Oh , yeah .
&#91; Finn is now sleeping on the ground . &#93;
Jake : It &apos;s two hours later now .
What the stunk ?
&#91; stretches up above the train , seeing that the train is going around in a circular track &#93; Oh , okay .
&#91; stretches back down &#93; Hey , the train just goes in a big circle !
We can cut right through the middle , blingle , blongle , blungle !
Come on !
&#91; grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train &#93; Wha-hey !
You know , I just had another idea !
If we just stay put here on the train , we could ride it all the way to the cave .
&#91; a door opens behind them &#93; Blingle , blongle , blungle !
&#91; A creature comes running toward them screaming . &#93;
Creature : Gimme !
Gimme the loot !
&#91; hits Finn &apos;s head &#93; Finn : Ow !
&#91; The creature stomps on Finn &apos;s toes . &#93;
Finn : Yeeow !
Creature : Gimme !
Gimme that hat !
&#91; grabs Finn &apos;s hat &#93; Finn : Knock it off !
&#91; punches him in the chest and bites his arm &#93; Creature : Aah !
&#91; Finn pushes him off the train . &#93;
Creature : Oh , dang !
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Jake : Hey , Finn !
Finn : Whoa !
Jake : Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt !
Finn : Dang , look at that sword !
&#91; picks up the Lightning Sword &#93; Whoa .
Feels kinda right .
&#91; waving it around &#93; Whoosh .
Whoosh .
Vvsh , vvsh .
&#91; points it at the wall , causing it to shoot electricity &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; Whoa !
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Pretty fun , huh ?
Finn : Yeah , man !
It &apos;s spicy baby fun !
Jake : You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train ?
Finn : Yes !
&#91; runs off &#93; Jake : &#91; following him &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; They enter a different car of the train , where some blue ants await , holding loot in each hand . &#93;
Finn : Whoa , Crystal Ants , I think !
&#91; runs past them , zapping each with his sword &#93; Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Cool !
&#91; picks up loot &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; They enter another car , where some rock monsters moan and walk toward them . &#93;
Finn : Ha-ha !
Yeah !
&#91; slicing each one &#93; Die , die , die , die , die , die , die !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; Scene changes to Finn fighting several monsters in quick succession .
The last one explodes , getting some of its goo on Jake . &#93;
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; to himself &#93; Welcome back , buddy .
Finn : Man , look at all this rad loot !
Jake : Yeah , this is a pretty neat train .
We should come back again someday .
Finn : Whoa , what do you mean ?
We just started only , like , three hours ago .
Jake : Heheh , yeah .
I &apos;m just gettin &apos; a little bored , is all .
All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same .
It &apos;s a little boring .
Finn : Oh , come on .
&#91; elbows him lightly &#93; It &apos;s fun !
Just one more car .
Come on .
&#91; elbows him &#93; Come on , man !
&#91; elbows him again &#93; Come on !
Jake : All right , just one more .
Finn : Ha-ha , yes !
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; &#91; They enter another car , but this one appears empty . &#93;
Finn : Hmm ?
Where is everybody ?
Jake : Hey , hey !
Empty car — think we beat it , buddy .
&#91; A door opens behind them , out of which comes a chubby green monster with a crown that shoot fires . &#93;
Finn : Whoa , man !
Boss battle !
Let &apos;s chew it up !
&#91; runs toward the monster &#93; Jake : Okay , but this is the last one , okay ?
Finn : We &apos;ll see !
&#91; The monster trips Finn and blasts fire at him , singeing his hat . &#93;
Finn : Ha-ha !
Jake : Hey , man , &#91; hitting monster with a stick &#93; you remember we were going to that weird cave ?
Bet it &apos;s not too late to check it out .
Finn : &#91; attacking monster &#93; Eh , weird cave , weird train — I &apos;m cool here .
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Okay .
Finn : Hyah !
&#91; hits the monster &apos;s crown &#93; &#91; A head grows out of the monster underneath its crown . &#93;
Head : Ahhhh , gimme a break !
&#91; The monster disappears in a flash of light and drops loot . &#93;
Finn : Oh ?
Oh , dang .
Boss loot !
&#91; puts on the crown and dances &#93; Oh , yeah .
&#91; the crown emits fire &#93; &#91; Jake picks up the rest of the loot and tries on a glove , which makes him chubby and green like the monster .
He quickly takes it off , throws it on the ground , and kicks it away . &#93;
Jake : No , thank you .
Finn : Jake , hurry .
Next car !
&#91; They enter the next car , which contains green jelly creatures . &#93;
Finn : Slime crimes !
&#91; starts fighting &#93; Jake : You have fun .
I &apos;m just gonna watch .
&#91; sits on a ledge away from the fight &#93; Finn : &#91; sees a gold shield one monster dropped &#93; Hey .
&#91; A monster squirts some green liquid at Finn , hitting the back of his leg . &#93;
Finn : Ow !
&#91; laughing &#93; Ow .
Cool ... acid !
&#91; The monster squirts again , but Finn picks up the shield and reflects it back at it , killing it .
Finn walks over to the loot it dropped .
Jake &apos;s stomach rumbles . &#93;
Jake : Hey , also , man , aren &apos;t you , like , gettin &apos; kinda hungry ?
Finn : Yeah , man .
I guess we &apos;ve been here for a while .
Jake : More than a while , dude .
I &apos;ve already missed my bathroom window !
Finn : Yeah , I guess I could take a snack break .
Jake : &apos; Kay !
Well , we &apos;ll go back to the tree house , and I &apos;ll make us some lunch .
I could make the toaster pancakes you like .
&#91; Finn kills a monster , which drops some meat . &#93;
Jake : And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs , or — Finn : &#91; eating noisily &#93; Look .
&#91; points to meat &#93; Now we don &apos;t gotta do that thing you wanted to do .
&#91; uses his crown &apos;s flames to throw the meat at Jake &#93; Jake : &#91; dodging it &#93; Aah !
Finn : Hot meat !
&#91; The scene changes to Finn entering another car , in which red ants await . &#93;
Jake : Ants again ?
&#91; goes to sit in the corner &#93; Finn : &quot; Ant &quot; no thang !
&#91; smashes one &#93; Yah !
&#91; smashes another &#93; Caught with your &quot; ants &quot; down !
&quot; Ants &quot; for nothin &apos; !
&#91; kills another &#93; Forget about &quot; ant &quot; !
&#91; kicks one &#93; What &apos;s wrong ?
Feeling antsy ?
&#91; kills another and continues killing them &#93; Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Dude , this is the ant car .
We already did the ant car .
We did all the ants !
Finn : Same car , &#91; punches an ant &#93; but those were blue ants .
These are red ants .
Jake : Finn , I think we should take off .
I think this place is bad news for you .
Finn : Man , no way .
All this feels good .
&#91; smashes another ant &#93; Like my inside voice is saying , &quot; Hey , keep it up .
This is good stuff . &quot;
&#91; two ants attack him &#93; Aah !
Hey !
&#91; knocks them away &#93; Ah !
Like when you made those biscuits way back ?
And I kept eating them until they were all gone .
Like that !
Jake : Finn , &#91; stands up &#93; I made those biscuits with so much butter .
You were just responding to the butter !
This whole place is butter !
Finn : Yeah !
&#91; smashes the last ant &#93; &#91; A door opens , out of which comes the second boss . &#93;
Finn : Boss fight !
&#91; charges at it , blasting fire from his crown &#93; &#91; The monster raises its wand and blasts Finn backwards . &#93;
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; &#91; gets back up and continues fighting offscreen &#93; &#91; Blasts from the monster &apos;s wand zoom by Jake , who is sitting in a corner .
He picks up a pair of pants that one of the ants dropped and puts them on .
Finn grunts and an explosion sounds . &#93;
Boss : My jacket-sta !
&#91; disappears in a flash of light &#93; Finn : &#91; holding loot &#93; Check it out : battle moon .
&#91; A small moons orbits around his head .
A crystal ball rolls toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : What ?
&#91; picks it up and looks in it &#93; &#91; gasps &#93; Finn !
This is a future crystal !
Look !
&#91; In the sphere is Finn in full armor , battling yellow Crystal Ants &#93; Jake : That &apos;s you , dude !
You &apos;re old , you &apos;re alone , and you &apos;re still fighting on this dumb train !
Future Finn : &#91; slashes the ants &#93; Get &quot; ant &quot; of town .
Finn : Whoa .
I &apos;m gonna have the best life !
&#91; Jake gapes . &#93;
&#91; Scene cuts to them entering another car .
Jake kicks the wall , and some Hair Apes shoot lightning at Finn , who blocks it with his shield . &#93;
Finn : Oh , Hair Apes !
Jake : Nuh-uh , dude .
I &apos;m bored , I &apos;m tired , and I &apos;m goin &apos; back to the tree house .
&#91; opens up the side of the train &#93; You can come with me if you want .
Finn : What ?
No , man !
It &apos;s better on the train ; stuff makes sense here .
Hair Ape : &#91; hoots &#93; &#91; zaps Finn &#93; Finn : Yow !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; shoots a bolt from his wand at the ape , killing it &#93; Jake : I &apos;m sorry .
If you wish to join me , I &apos;ll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair .
Finn : You &apos;ll be back .
Jake : No , I won &apos;t , Finn .
&#91; hops onto the outside of the train &#93; Goodbye !
&#91; He makes it sound like he &apos;s getting farther away by making his face smaller .
He looks back in at Finn . &#93;
Finn : &#91; sighs &#93; &#91; A Hair Ape shoots some lightning at Finn , but his battle moon blocks it . &#93;
Hair Ape : &#91; hoots &#93; Finn : Hey !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; runs toward it &#93; &quot; Hair &quot; we go !
Jake : &#91; climbs on top of the rain , finding a Hair Ape &#93; What &apos;re you doin &apos; up here ?
Hair Ape : &#91; hoots &#93; &#91; shrugs &#93; Jake : &#91; takes off his hat and sits next to it &#93; Are you gettin &apos; sick of things down there , too ?
Hair Ape : &#91; hoots &#93; Jake : Mm-hmm .
&#91; He takes off his pack , and the Hair Ape pats his leg invitingly . &#93;
Jake : You &apos;re not gonna try and zap me , are you ?
&#91; The Hair Ape shrugs .
Jake rests his head on the Hair Ape &apos;s leg and looks up at the stars . &#93;
Jake : I wonder what my kids are doin &apos; .
&#91; falls asleep &#93; &#91; Morning arrives , and Jake hears the Hair Ape rubbing his hands together to zap him . &#93;
Jake : Hey !
&#91; dodges zap &#93; I knew it !
&#91; He hits the Hair Ape , which disappears in a flurry of hair .
He then picks up his pack , puts on his hat , and picks up the Hair Ape &apos;s hat . &#93;

Jake : Wait , you are !
You are one !
Finn : What ?
Those guys are cool !
Jake : That &apos;s it , man !
I &apos;m gettin &apos; you off this train whether you like it or not !
&#91; advancing toward him &#93; Finn : Jake , stay back .
I mean it !
Jake : Oh , please .
What &apos;re you gonna do ?
I &apos;m ten times stronger than — &#91; Finn squirts a large amount of silk at him with his spider wand . &#93;
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Jake : Ah , gross !
&#91; coughs &#93; Finn : &#91; grabs Jake &apos;s pack &#93; Yoink !

Jake : You mean we &apos;re gettin &apos; off the train ?
Finn : Well ... you are .

Finn : Mmhm .
Ice King : With your lies and secrets ?

Jake : Dude , you can &apos;t stay here if you &apos;re gonna stank it up with your bad vibes , man !

I &apos;ve given Gunter temporary reign .
&#91; Gunter , wearing Ice King &apos;s crown , is shown constructing ice structures . &#93;
Ice King : Should be fine .

Ice King : You &apos;re blind , Finn .
You &apos;re blind — wait , she isn &apos;t here , is she ?
Finn : No .
Ice King : Whew !
Finn : She said she wanted time to herself .

Flame Princess : Hmm ?
&#91; to creature &#93; I thought Finn was a stand-up guy , you know ?
But he basically betrayed me .
&#91; Spider creature shakes his head sympathetically . &#93;
Flame Princess : Why do people even have secrets ?
&#91; Her heat radiation intensifies and the spider hurriedly scrambles up its silk . &#93;
Flame Princess : It &apos;s like that in the Fire Kingdom , too .
Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare .
But out here doesn &apos;t seem any different .
&#91; scribbling sounds are heard &#93; Why do I have to feel like this ?
&#91; hears scribbling sounds &#93; And what is that noise ? !
Grrr !

Just act like I &apos;m not here .
Flame Princess : &#91; gasps &#93; Are you spying on me ? !
Princess Bubblegum : What ? !
No , of course not !
&#91; Several cameras and a microphone spontaneously reveal themselves .
Princess Bubblegum hits a button on her watch and they become invisible again . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : I was observing you — for research .
&#91; sighs &#93; You &apos;re a threat , Flame Princess .
Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels .
But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix , I can isolate and suppress your more ... volatile traits .
Flame Princess : So , if you do your research , you &apos;ll know how to cut off my emotions so I won &apos;t feel like this ?
Princess Bubblegum : Umm , yeah , basically !
Flame Princess : Then I &apos;ll help you .
Princess Bubblegum : You will ?
Flame Princess : Yes .
I &apos;ll do whatever it takes .

Flame Princess : This is going to help me understand myself ?
Princess Bubblegum : There &apos;s a 40 % chance we &apos;ll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components — and yes , understand you in a very scientific way .
Flame Princess : Oh .
That &apos;s good ...
I guess .
Princess Bubblegum : Initiate test .
&#91; a phone drops down and knocks her hand away from the button &#93; Yah .
&#91; puts phone to her ear &#93; Hello ?
Jake : Princess !
We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away !
Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes , or snow-a-constrictors !

Cinnamon Bun : Yes .
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , one other thing .
Do not open that door .

Cinnamon Bun : Ha , me too .

&#91; walks into coffee table , leaving a notch in his leg &#93; Ow .
My body is soft .
&#91; extends leg toward Flame Princess &#93; &#91; Flame Princess places her hand on the wound , healing it perfectly . &#93;
Cinnamon Bun : &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; shakes his leg &#93; We &apos;re friends .
Flame Princess : Yeah , I really get you , but sometimes friends are hard to understand .
Sometimes you think you know them , but you find out they &apos;re just playing mind games .
Cinnamon Bun : Is the princess your friend ?
Flame Princess : I don &apos;t know .
Cinnamon Bun : Yeah , because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby ?
That was a weird friend thing .

Flame King : Okay , you got me .
I had her sent to wander in the woods .
I was in fear of being usurped .
Come on .
Princess Bubblegum : That &apos;s your problem , but you can &apos;t just let her run around the woods .
She &apos;s too dangerous .
Find some way to contain her power , or I will .
Flame King : Pssh , fine .

Flame Princess : &#91; stands up &#93; &#91; groans in frustration &#93; Is everybody in this world hiding something ?
Cinnamon Bun : It &apos;s fun to hide .
Flame Princess : You &apos;re all right .
Why can &apos;t everybody be honest like you ?
Maybe I should just go back where I belong .
Cinnamon Bun : Wait , do you mean baby jail ?
Flame Princess : I don &apos;t know , man .
Cinnamon Bun : Mmmm ... &#91; Scene cuts to Finn and Princess Bubblegum walking up to a metal door . &#93;
Finn : Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things .
&#91; Finn shakes snow off his head as Princess Bubblegum pushes buttons on a keypad next to the door . &#93;
Finn : So , uh , why am I here again ?
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , I just wanted to measure Flame Princess &apos;s reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart .

If Flame Princess goes back there , her evil dad will lock her up again !
Princess Bubblegum : And if she &apos;s imprisoned , I won &apos;t be able to complete my tests , and I &apos;ll have wasted my precious time !
Finn : We gotta save her .
Let &apos;s doogie !
&#91; Scene cuts to Fire Kingdom .
Finn and Princess Bubblegum , dressed in fireproof suits , walk up to a couple Flame Guards . &#93;
Flame Guard # 1 : State your business here , and be quick about it .
Sorry , I &apos;m on edge &apos; cause I &apos;m worried that Jerry here will find out I &apos;m dating his sister .
&#91; Jerry turns his head . &#93;
Finn : Listen , we need to get into the castle right now .
Flame Guard # 1 : Yeah , but why ?
Finn : Grrr !
So I can go to your mama &apos;s house !
Now get outta my way !
Jerry : Doesn &apos;t your mom live in a nursing home ?
Flame Guard # 1 : Yeah , and in a different city .
C &apos;mon , dude , you gotta be honest here .
Finn : Honest my fist !
&#91; punches Flame Guard , pushes him down , and headbutts Jerry &#93; Come on , Princess !
&#91; The two run inside but are blasted back by a huge fireball . &#93;
Flame Guard # 2 : D &apos;aw , yeah !
Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch !
I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef .
Finn : Man .
&#91; A Flame Person walks up to the three guards . &#93;
Jerry : Halt .
What is your business here ?
Flame Person : I need to get inside to file my taxes .
Also I like using the bathroom here .
Also I like to crop dust the lobby .
Flame Guard # 2 : Pass , friend .
Finn : Alright , so you wanna get nasty ?
One time , I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away .
Then it hit some lady &apos;s baby in the face , and it started crying .
Princess Bubblegum : And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes .
Flame Guard # 1 : Uh , that &apos;s cool and all , but you still haven &apos;t told us why you want to get in .
Princess Bubblegum : We need to see the king ?
Flame Guard # 1 : Well , why didn &apos;t you just say so ?
Right this way , friends .
&#91; leads them inside &#93; There you go : &#91; Flame Princess is seated on the throne wearing royal garb &#93; the new Flame King .
Finn : Flame Princess ?
Flame Princess : Finn ?
Finn : You &apos;re okay !
Um , how &apos;s it going ?
Flame Princess : Pretty good .
Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad .
Princess Bubblegum : Oh-ho , that &apos;s why the guards were wigging out .
Flame Princess : That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom .
Total honesty is the law of the land — no secrets .
Finn : Oh .
Flame King : &#91; from inside lantern &#93; Right , can you believe this nonsense ?
Once I get outta here , I &apos;m gonna ground you for real .
No snacks , no friends , no popular music .
Flame Princess : You never let me have any of those things !
You were a selfish king and a bad parent !
Flame King : But I did it for you , honey — for you not to overthrow me like you just did .
Flame Princess : You belong in that lamp !
And if you don &apos;t settle down , you &apos;ll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun !
Cinnamon Bun : &#91; wearing a conical fire hat &#93; Hi .
Finn : Wow .
She &apos;s even awesomer than I remember .
Princess Bubblegum : Take off that silly hat .
We &apos;re going home .
Cinnamon Bun : No .
Look , &#91; pets Jake 2 &#93; got a real dog now !
Hah .
Finn : Flame Princess , listen .
I &apos;m really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings , and I was a big fat jerk — Flame Princess : Finn , it &apos;s okay .
It &apos;s in the past now .
Finn : So , does that mean we &apos;re still going out ?
Flame Princess : No .
I &apos;ve realized my place is here , ruling these weak and vicious Fire People .
Finn : I see .
&#91; gets on the ground and goes into fetal position &#93; Flame Princess : But we &apos;re cool .
You &apos;re welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing .
Finn : &#91; stands up &#93; Anything .
Flame Princess : That you &apos;ll be completely honest with me .
Finn : Heh .
Okay .
I promise .
Flame Princess : &#91; laughs lightly &#93; I &apos;m serious .
Finn : Hmm .
&#91; In the Tree Fort , Jake is knitting on the couch and humming to himself .
A fly-sized Magic Man flies in and lands on his head . &#93;
Magic Man : Bzzz , bzzz , bzzz , bzzz .
The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough .
&#91; injects Jake with syringe &#93; Bzzzzz ... &#91; flies away &#93; Jake : &#91; stops humming &#93; Hmm .
&#91; rubs eyes &#93; I &apos;ll ...
I &apos;ll finish this later .
&#91; yawns and lies down &#93; So tired .
And also hungry ... &#91; rubs belly &#93; Maybe I should ... eat some — &#91; starts snoring &#93; &#91; Jake &apos;s face starts sliding down from his head and onto his chest .
It then sinks into his body .
Jake wakes up looking at a yellow sky . &#93;
Jake : Huh ?
Uh ... &#91; touches yellow grass &#93; Huh .
Hmm .
Everything &apos;s made of ... me .
&#91; A forest , mountains , and a flower grow out of the ground . &#93;
Jake : Pretty neat .
I bet there &apos;s , like — like a cool city or something around here .
&#91; A city grows out of the ground . &#93;
Jake : Nice .
Jake City .
&#91; walks into city &#93; &#91; Inside , Jake People grow out of the sidewalk and walk past him while waving . &#93;
Jake Person : Hi !
Jake : Oh , uh , hi !
&#91; Across the street , some more people wave to him . &#93;
Jake Person : Jake !
How you doing , Jake ?
Jake : &#91; waving &#93; Uh , good , man !
Good !
&#91; A car drives past ; its driver waves . &#93;
Jake : Man , this place is awesome !
&#91; approaches a storefront &#93; Ooh !
&#91; looks through glass &#93; Cool dolls !
They look like the rare antique kind .
Maybe my kids will like them .
Mm .
Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner .
Maybe pizza ... &#91; The ground starts rumbling . &#93;
Jake : Whoa-oh !
Some kind of Jake-quake ... &#91; Behind him , Goose grows out of the ground . &#93;
Goose : Eh ?
Is that Jake ?
Jake : &#91; turns around &#93; Hey there , um ...
Goose : C &apos;mon , man !
It &apos;s Goose !
Your best friend , Goose !
Jake : Oh , uh , of course !
Goose !
Goose : Aww , Jake , Jake , Jake , Jake , Jake , ya big goof !
How long &apos;s it been ?
Two , three years ?
Jake : Let &apos;s see , uh ... &#91; counts on fingers &#93; one , two , uh ...
I &apos;ve never been here .
Goose : &#91; laughs &#93; &quot; I &apos;ve never been here . &quot;
You &apos;ve still got it , Jake .
Jake : &#91; fake-laughs &#93; Goose : C &apos;mon !
Let &apos;s get you home .
Everyone &apos;s waiting for you at the party .
Jake : Eh — party ?
Goose : No .
Par-tay !
&#91; Jake and Goose walk to the party .
Outside the building , a group of people cheer and applaud his arrival , and a band plays a lively tune .
A banner reads &quot; WELCOME HOME JAKE . &quot;
Inside , portraits of Jake and his family line the walls , and dozens of partygoers dance .
Jake and Goose are building card houses . &#93;
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Do it again , Goose !
&#91; Goose bounces his head up and down so his jowls slap together . &#93;
Jake : &#91; laughs &#93; Goose : Hey , Jake .
Jake : Hey , what ?
Goose : Now that you &apos;re back , how &apos; bout that five bucks you still owe me ?
Jake : Uh , what five bucks ?
Goose : Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell ?
&#91; Just then , another Jake-quake shakes the building . &#93;
Jake : What — ?
What is that ?
Goose : Oh , oh , that .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
Do not — don &apos;t worry about that .
Jake : &#91; thinking &#93; Guess I &apos;d better not worry about it .
&#91; aloud &#93; Hmm .
I &apos;m hungies , Goose .
Goose : I think there &apos;s a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge .
&#91; The building rumbles briefly , knocking down the partially built card houses . &#93;
Goose : &#91; leaving &#93; Just a sec .
&#91; gets food from the fridge and returns &#93; Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches !
&#91; Another brief Jake-quake occurs . &#93;
Jake : All right !
&#91; takes a bite &#93; Ow !
Something &apos;s wrong , Goose .
Jakey can &apos;t eat any of these nachos ... &#91; ground rumbles &#93; but Jakey needs nachos !
Aah !
&#91; Someone knocks on the front door .
Jake answers it . &#93;
Urchin : Mr. Jake !
Mr. Jake !
Mr. Jake , the Mayor wants to see you straightaway .
Jake : Alright , lad , show me the way !
&#91; follows Urchin &#93; &#91; In the Tree Fort , Finn walks up to Jake . &#93;
Finn : Jake !
Hey , I got a for-real important question : do you like cereal in your cake ?
Jake ?
&#91; pats him &#93; Hmm ... &#91; shrugs and smiles &#93; Mm-mm-mm .
Urchin : Mr. Mayor .
Mayor : Urchin , thank you for your help .
Help yourself to the herring cakes .
Urchin : Right-o !
Mayor : &#91; shaking Jake &apos;s hand &#93; Hello , Jake .
Thanks for making it .
Jake : Heh .
Okay .
Mayor : Now look , we &apos;re at orange alert here .
Below us are gathered the city &apos;s top minds .
Jake : Hmm .
Mayor : And they &apos;ve noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival .
Jake : Mayor , uh , I want to meet these minds .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Mayor and Jake on the floor with the scientists . &#93;
Mayor : Here are some of the minds .
Scientist : Jake , we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes .
Jake : There &apos;s no need .
I &apos;ve got it figured out .
The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry , &#91; pats belly &#93; and his stomach is growling .
And the hungrier he gets , the worse the quakes will become .
&#91; The Mayor and the scientists laugh out loud . &#93;
Jake : I &apos;ll prove it !
Scientists : Huh ?
Jake : Mention a food item .
Scientist : Omelet .
&#91; The ground rumbles . &#93;
Jake : What &apos;s in the omelet ?
&#91; The ground briefly shakes again . &#93;
Scientist : Chili !
It &apos;s a four-egg chili omelet !
&#91; The ground shakes violently .
A large metal pole falls toward them . &#93;
Scientist : Watch out !
&#91; It crashes to the ground , leaving the scientists unharmed . &#93;
Scientist : Analysis , Tim !
Tim : It &apos;s too early to say ; this evidence is anecdotal !
Jake : Look , just let me stretch outside to get something to eat , and the quakes will stop .
Tim : That doesn &apos;t sound very science-y .
Scientist : No , but you have my permission to test your idea .
Erik Adamkinson : I don &apos;t like that idea .
Scientists : Huh ?
Erik Adamkinson : If Jake leaves , that would mean the utter destruction of our world .
I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being , a Glob if you will , whose psychic field holds our world together .
If he leaves , his flesh will reconfigure , and everything and everyone here will disappear completely !
Tim : Oh , Erik Adamkinson , you &apos;re just a fringe scientist , well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories .
Erik Adamkinson : Hm !
Perhaps I am .
And maybe I am wrong ... but are you really willing to take that chance ?
We should imprison Jake immediately !
Jake : What ? !
No way !
The world &apos;s not gonna end just because I go get a bagel .
&#91; The ground shakes . &#93;
Mayor : Seize him !
Jake : Uh , peace !
&#91; grows in size &#93; &#91; Several Jake People jump on him and hold him down . &#93;
Jake : Why ? !
Mayor : Finish him .
&#91; One last Jake Person jumps on Jake , landing on Jake &apos;s face .
Jake is now in a tiny cell , guarded by two Jake People . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sadly &#93; Mm .
&#91; longingly &#93; Bagel .
&#91; Jake &apos;s stomach growls , and the ground shakes . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : Don &apos;t worry , everybody .
I will journey to Jake &apos;s Glob world , which , legend would have us believe , lies beyond the great sky-hole , and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake &apos;s appetite , thus saving everybody .
&#91; The crowd cheers .
One Jake Person runs after Erik Adamkinson . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson &apos;s father : Wait !
Wait !
&#91; hugs Erik Adamkinson &#93; I want to go with you , Son !
Erik Adamkinson : I-I &apos;m sorry , Dad .
Y-you can &apos;t ; i-it &apos;s too dangerous .
Your mind is unprepared .
Erik Adamkinson &apos;s father : My son .
&#91; weeps &#93; &#91; Erik Adamkinson climbs to the top of a mountain and then climbs the wall .
A balloon floats next to him . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : Huh ?
&#91; grabs balloon &#93; Yeah !
&#91; The balloon takes him higher . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : There it is , the sky ho-o-o-o-ole !
&#91; Erik Adamkinson passes through the sky-hole and climbs onto Jake &apos;s body .
Projected on a screen nearby is a movie with a bear and a rabbit . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : Phew !
Oh , my stars !
It &apos;s just as I envisioned !
Almighty Jake Globs , I beseech your aid !
Do you have bagels ?
Hello ?
Hmm .
Maybe those aren &apos;t the true globs .
Yeah , they &apos;re too ugly to be — &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; Finn lifts his head with spaghetti hanging out of his mouth and looks at Erik Adamkinson . &#93;
Erik Adamkinson : &#91; screams and then weeps &#93; I thought you &apos;d be beautiful .
But you &apos;re not !
&#91; cries &#93; You &apos;re hideous !
Hideous !
&#91; melts into Jake &apos;s body &#93; Finn : &#91; points to projector &#93; BMO , resume .
&#91; Back in Jake World &#93; Jake : Spaghetti ... &#91; stomach rumbles &#93; &#91; In the city , the dolls Jake was looking at earlier fall down as people scream in panic .
Outside Jake &apos;s cell , one guard is checking his phone , while the other is about to touch him with his spear . &#93;
Guard : Don &apos;t !
&#91; The guards hear a slapping sound . &#93;
Guards : Huh ?
&#91; Out of a bush pops Goose , slapping his jowls together .
The guards laugh and run to him . &#93;
Guard : Hey , you &apos;re a le — &#91; Goose smacks them down with his jowls . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Huh ?
&#91; Goose bends the bars of the cell with his jowls . &#93;
Jake : Goose ?
Goose : Go .
Jake : But — but what if Erik Adamkinson is right ?
What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can &apos;t bring you back ?
Goose : Then you won &apos;t have to pay me back that five bucks .
Jake : But — &#91; Goose slaps Jake with his jowls . &#93;
Goose : Go eat , Jake !
&#91; Jake takes a huge breath , steps out of his cell , and stretches straight up .
Goose waves goodbye as he is pulled into the ground .
As Jake grows taller , Jake People in the city get pulled into the ground , and then the city gets pulled in .
Jake yells as he continues stretching his way up to the sky hole .
The screen goes black . &#93;
Finn : Uh , Jake ?
What &apos;s going on , man ?
Feeling okay ?
Jake : &#91; eating beans &#93; Just getting a snack , Goose .
&#91; sheds a tear &#93; Just getting a snack .
&#91; The scene begins at the Tree Fort . &#93;
Jake : And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought , the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it !
Finn : No way !
Jake : Yes way , it did .
And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist .
&#91; warbling with tongue &#93; Finn : Ah , jeez !
Jake , is this stuff you &apos;re saying true ?
Or are you just trying to mess me up ?
You have to be honest .
Jake : Oh , it &apos;s true , man .
I heard it through a reliable source .
Finn : Reliable ?
Rats !
Jake : Yeah .
Some say it haunted this very tree !
Finn : This tree ? !
Jake : &#91; ominously &#93; Good niiiight ... Finn : Jake ?
&#91; Jake warbling downstairs &#93; Finn : You &apos;re full of it , Jake !
&#91; Jake warbling ominously &#93; Finn : Errr ... &#91; he hears croaking and sees a worm on his bed &#93; NO WORMS ON THE BED !
&#91; Hits worm with the Enchiridion . &#93;
&#91; Sees a tree limb tapping on his window , then a mysterious figure taps on the window &#93; Finn : Huh ?
&#91; Lightning crashes , and the figure &apos;s scary face is seen &#93; Finn : AAAAAH ! ! !
&#91; Runs downstairs &#93; Finn : Jake !
Jake !
I saw someone outside the window !
It must be the vampire , and I think we &apos;re unprepared , so I-- Jake : Relax , buddy .
I made that story up .
I was just trying to scare you .
Finn : But you said you heard it from a reliable source !
Jake : Ha ha !
I made that up , too .
I was trying to scare you , and it worked !
&#91; laughs &#93; &#91; the window blows open by itself , the lights go out , and Jake screams &#93; Finn : No one &apos;s outside .
Jake : Whew !
Finn : It was just the wind , scaredy-cat .
Jake : I wasn &apos;t scared , I was singing .
I was singing my scream song .
Ahh !
Ahh !
AAaah-uh-aah !
Finn : You &apos;re a total wuss , man .
&#91; a bag drops , there is a vampire on the ceiling that hisses and scares Finn and Jake &#93; Marceline : Hey , guys .
What &apos;s up ?
I &apos;m Marceline the Vampire Queen .
Finn : &#91; afraid &#93; Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist ? !
Jake : Don &apos;t suck our blood !
Marceline : &#91; laughing &#93; Calm down , weenies .
I &apos;m not gonna do that .
&#91; Lights candles &#93; Finn : Soooo , you don &apos;t suck blood ?
Marceline : Sometimes , I do .
But it &apos;s not the blood that I like .
It &apos;s the color .
I eat shades of red .
&#91; Sucks the red out of a strawberry , and gives it to Finn &#93; Marceline : Ugh , I am exhausted .
I &apos;ve been traveling all over the Land of Ooo .
And I &apos;ve seen some stuff that would really make you say &quot; like what ? &quot;
Finn : Like what ?
Marceline : I encountered a school of goldfish beasts .
&#91; A flashback of Marceline riding giant goldfish &#93; Marceline : And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom .
&#91; A flashback of Marceline hula-hooping in the Fire Kingdom &#93; Finn : OOO !
Marceline : Oh , and check these out .
&#91; She has nuts in her hands &#93; Finn : Nuts ?
Marceline : Oh , these aren &apos;t ordinary nuts .
&#91; Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures .
One squirts Finn with ink . &#93;
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; You &apos;re wonderful .
Jake : Um , yeah .
Thank you for not sucking our blood .
Marceline : You guys seem cool , too , but as you can imagine , I &apos;m really tired , so you two should probably get going .
Finn : What ?
Marceline : &#91; sighs &#93; Look .
&#91; She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an &quot; M &quot; carved into the tree &#93; &quot; M &quot; for &quot; Marceline . &quot;
Jake : Aw , man .
Marceline : I carved in this tree years ago .
Way before you two rascals started squatting here .
&#91; Flings them out &#93; Marceline : But seriously guys , thanks for keeping the place warm for me , I mean really great !
&#91; Shuts the door &#93; Marceline : Good night !
Jake : Come on , Finn .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
Finn : She can &apos;t kick us out of our house !
Jake : Finn !
Finn : Get down here , lady , and fight me !
Jake : She &apos;s a vampire , dude !
&#91; Marceline sucks the red out of a crumpet , and throws it onto Finn &#93; Finn : I &apos;m gonna kill her .
Jake : Dude , if half the stories I &apos;ve heard , and / or made up are true , vampires will kill you .
There &apos;s no question !
&#91; Marceline hisses at them and then walks away , laughing &#93; Finn : But , what about our home ?
Jake : A VAMPIRE TOOK IT !
Aw , we should go house-hunting .
Bag us a new house .
Finn : But I like our home .
Jake : Finn , house-hunting is wild !
You &apos;ve got to try it .
Finn : Really ?
Jake : Yeah , man !
It is so nuts !
Finn : You always know what to say .
Jake : Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop !
Finn : ( laughs ) Okay .
I &apos;m convinced .
Let &apos;s roll !
Jake : Sweet , things are gonna start going our way .
&#91; Clouds separate to reveal the sun &#93; Hey , look , see ?
What &apos;d I tell ya ?
&#91; House Hunting Song begins &#93; Finn : This is weak !
I don &apos;t even like any of these places .
I wanna go home .
Jake : Finn , let me tell you a little something about what home really means .
&#91; plays viola &#93; La , la , la ... &#91; singing &#93; Home isn &apos;t a place , let me give you a clue ... Home is anywhere , where people care about you ... Finn : I don &apos;t wanna hear a lecture , dude !
I just wanna go home ... Jake : &#91; singing &#93; But , home is where your heart is , Finn !
And where is your heart , Finn ?
Well , it &apos;s right here inside you when I &apos;m sitting here beside you !
&#91; talking &#93; With your lucky stars to guide you from above .
&#91; They look up , a star floats around , then poofs and disappears &#93; Finn : Yeah , I guess I &apos;d rather be out here , wrapped in your ear , than be in some awesome house all by my ... souse .
Jake : I &apos;d rather be dancing with some babes !
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Shut up , dude !
Jake : Ew ...
Gross .
This place looks gross !
Finn : And abandoned .
&#91; Echoes &#93; &#91; both scream &#93; Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; Whoa , bro ... Wanna just live in here ?
Jake : Yes .
♪ &quot; So they cleaned the cave and built a house inside the cave .
♪ Jake : So whaddaya think , man ?

Jake : &#91; yells &#93; Finn : What ! ?
Marceline : I &apos;ll bite him a little , maybe turn him into a zombie .
Jake : Nooo !
Finn : Let go of Jake !
Marceline : Make me .
&#91; Finn slaps Jake out of Marceline &apos;s grip &#93; Finn : You okay , pal ?
Marceline : &#91; transforming &#93; No one ... makes me ... let go ... of Jake !
Finn : I &apos;m not scared of you !
Jake : Finn !
Marceline : &#91; laughs &#93; You &apos;re pathetic , little boy !
Finn : &#91; grunts &#93; You &apos;re pathetic !
&#91; Spits &#93; Get ready for an uppercut , you dog !
Marceline : Make me .
&#91; Slaps Finn &apos;s butt and laughs &#93; Bleh-bleh !
Blah !
Jake : I &apos;ve ... gotta help my buddy .
Marceline : Your blood is mine !
Jake : &#91; warbles &#93; Finn : &#91; screaming &#93; Jake !
Jake : Uh oh .
&#91; Marceline sucks Jake &apos;s blood and throws Jake &apos;s remains on the ground ; she laughs . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Screams ; runs up to her and punches her in the face &#93; Marceline : Ow !
That actually hurt , Finn .
&#91; laughs and kisses him on the cheek , making him blush . &#93;
Finn : Why didn &apos;t you just kill me ?
Marceline : &apos; Cuz that was fun !
I haven &apos;t fought like that in years !
Thanks , Finn .
Jake : Finn !
Finn : Aren &apos;t you dead ?
Jake : Naaah , before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb , see ?
&#91; Does so &#93; Marceline : &#91; Clears throat &#93; You two are pretty hardcore .
I can appreciate that .
Finn : Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back ?
Marceline : Yeah !
Keep it , as a gift from me .
Blaeargh !
&#91; Finn and Jake both run away screaming &#93; &#91; Scene cuts back to the tree fort &#93; Finn and Jake : Yeah !
Finn : Huh ?
Did you guys get on the bed ?
I told you , YOU &apos;RE NOT ALLOWED !
King Worm : Oh , hey , guys .
Come here , friends ...
Hug me ... wawawawawawawa ... Aw , yeah , hug me ... wawawawawawawawa ... &#91; Episode ends &#93; &#91; A thunderstorm rages outside the Tree Fort .
Inside , BMO is practicing karate . &#93;
BMO : Kya !
Kya !
&#91; reading karate magazine &#93; Hmm .
&#91; The magazine reads , &quot; How to stop a man &apos;s heart with karate : 1 .
&apos;Focus chi &apos; and 2 .
&apos;Stop a man &apos;s heart &apos; &quot; with diagrams depicting each action . &#93;
BMO : Ohhh , that &apos;s pretty good .
Kya !
&#91; punches a hole in the punchbag pillow &#93; Jake : &#91; covers ears &#93; BMO ... keep it down !
BMO : But you said 8 : 00 to 10 : 00 is my time to do karate .
It &apos;s my karate time !
Jake : I know , but I got a headache , and I &apos;m in a funky mood .
Finn : What &apos;s wrong , dude ?
Jake : I don &apos;t know .
I think I got restless leg syndrome .
Finn : Is that from getting chubby ?
Jake : What ?
No , man , it &apos;s just restless leg .
Finn : Oop !
My bad .
Jake : What are you reading ?
Finn : This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine — the only magazine for boy adventurers .
This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters .
This magazine rules !
But I &apos;m saving the end for tomorrow .
&#91; closes magazine &#93; Jake : Cool .
Finn : Well , I hope your leg feels better .
I &apos;m turning in .
I &apos;ll see you up there .
Jake : &#91; blows raspberry &#93; BMO : &#91; sing-song &#93; Jake ... Jake : No , BMO .
BMO : KYA !
&#91; punches pillow &#93; Jake : &#91; screams &#93; No , BMO !
No more !
&#91; walking into kitchen &#93; Maybe some soup will take the edge off .
&#91; Jake starts preparing a pot of soup .
A fly lands on the edge and slurps it . &#93;
Jake : Ew !
Gross !
Nasty !
&#91; smacks it with a flyswatter &#93; Hyah !
&#91; The fly flails its legs a little , then stops moving . &#93;
Jake : I &apos;m sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you , you disgusting , disgusting creature .
BMO : Kya !
Kya !
Kya !
Jake : BMO , PLEASE !
&#91; Outside , the rain has stopped .
Jake climbs upstairs and into his bed . &#93;
Jake : &#91; yawns , smacks lips &#93; &#91; Suddenly , some rattling and knocking sounds are heard coming from downstairs . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sits up &#93; Finn , was that you ?
Finn : &#91; snores &#93; Jake : &#91; lies back down &#93; Probably just BMO or something .
&#91; The record downstairs is heard playing jazz . &#93;
Jake : That &apos;s weird .
BMO doesn &apos;t like 30 &apos;s jazz .
&#91; climbs downstairs &#93; Yeesh .
Creepy .
&#91; takes the needle off the record &#93; &#91; On a shelf above Jake , a toy monkey starts clacking its cymbals together repeatedly . &#93;
Jake : &#91; gasps &#93; &#91; fearfully &#93; I didn &apos;t know we had one of those .
Voice : &#91; spookily &#93; Oooooo ... Jake : &#91; panting &#93; Hey , hey .
Hey , who ?
&#91; A ghost fly appears and slowly moves toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
Ghost Fly : Ooooooo ... Jake : Hey !
I killed you !
&#91; The fly swoops at Jake and buzzes around his head . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
&#91; tries waving it away , then runs &#93; Aah !
Ghost fly touching me !
&#91; climbs upstairs &#93; Finn !
Finn !
&#91; The fly continues buzzing around Jake . &#93;
Finn : &#91; jerks awake &#93; Aah !
Jake : Ghost fly , man !
Aah !
Aah !
Finn : Okay .
Jake : Come on , man .
Let &apos;s get out of the house .
It &apos;s a ghost fly !
Finn : So what ?
Jake : No , man , ghost flies are filthy !
They carry diseases , such as tuberculosis , polio , dysentery .
They leave those little fly doodies on your soul .
&#91; The ghost fly swoops in and out of Jake &apos;s torso . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
&#91; The ghost fly conjures a scythe out of nowhere and chases after Finn and Jake .
They dodge its attack and jump downstairs . &#93;
BMO : Finn , Jake !
What &apos;s wrong ? !
Finn &amp; Jake : Ghost fly !
BMO : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; The three run out of the tree fort .
They stop after a few seconds . &#93;
Jake : &#91; sighs &#93; Thank goodness we lost him .
He &apos;s gone .
&#91; Suddenly , the ghost fly appears beside him . &#93;
Ghost Fly : Whoo .
&#91; swishes scythe &#93; Jake : &#91; screams &#93; BMO : Run !
Just run !
&#91; Jake and BMO bump into Finn . &#93;
Finn : Ay-ay-ay-ay !
&#91; They all run back into the Tree Fort , with the ghost fly follows closely .
BMO stops and turns around to face it . &#93;
BMO : Hmm .
&#91; punching &#93; Kya !
Kya !
&#91; The ghost fly telepathically levitates BMO and throws it against the wall . &#93;
Jake : We should ask what its unfinished business is .
Ghosts always have unfinished business .
Finn : Ghost fly , what &apos;s your problem ? !
&#91; The ghost fly swipes its scythe at him . &#93;
Finn : Come on , dude .
Tell us your unfinished business !
&#91; The ghost fly swipes two more times . &#93;
Finn : Aah !
It &apos;s no good .
He &apos;s a tortured little spirit .
We need help to communicate with this ghost fly .
Jake : Nah , man , let &apos;s just get someone to banish it — someone with serious paranormal juice .
&#91; dials phone &#93; &#91; The scene cuts to a silhouette sitting at a table .
His phone rings twice ; he silences it .
The silhouette , wearing a hat and carrying a bag , approaches the Tree Fort .
Back inside , Finn , Jake , and BMO are hiding inside a suit of armor . &#93;
BMO : Is he coming soon ?
Jake : I think so .
His ways are kind of mysterious .
Finn : That &apos;s cool .
&#91; The ghost fly flies into the suit of armor . &#93;
Finn , Jake &amp; BMO : &#91; scream &#93; &#91; Finn throws off the top half of the armor and runs .
Clattering and shouting are heard offscreen as the mysterious person enters the Tree Fort .
Finn , Jake , and BMO are hiding behind a table barricade while the fly swipes at them .
On hearing the person enter , the fly turns toward him . &#93;
Ghost Fly : Woo ?
Peppermint Butler : Let &apos;s get this ritual rolling .
I got stuff to do .
Ghost Fly : Woo !
&#91; swipes at Peppermint Butler &#93; Peppermint Butler : Hey !
No !
Unclean demon , feel the sting of holy water !
&#91; throws water at the ghost fly &#93; &#91; The ghost fly dodges it and flies into a hole in the wall . &#93;
Jake : &#91; quietly &#93; Thank you .
Peppermint Butler : &#91; drawing chalk circles around Finn , Jake , and BMO &#93; These circles will protect you from the ghost &apos;s attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual .
Worry not , fellow believers , for in this bag , I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place .
We &apos;re perfectly safe — as long as ... &#91; the ghost fly picks up the bag &#93; we ... have ... &#91; The ghost fly takes the bag into the hole in the wall .
Peppermint Butler puts his hat on , jumps out the window , and runs away .
The ghost fly comes out and flies toward Jake but is stopped by the circle . &#93;
Jake : Well , huh .
How about that ?
No biggie .
We &apos;ll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning .
That &apos;s when ghosts go to sleep .
Yep .
Just got to make it ... till morning .
&#91; The ghost fly buzzes in circles around them while wailing spookily .
A time lapse shows storm clouding rolling past the Tree Fort .
Eventually , the ghost fly stops . &#93;
Ghost Fly : Woo !
&#91; flies offscreen &#93; &#91; Finn hears the sound of papers rustling . &#93;
Finn : Hmm ?
&#91; On the table , the magazine he was reading flips to the page he was on and turns toward him . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; The end of my story .
And it &apos;s so close .
Jake : Don &apos;t do it , bro .
It &apos;s a trap .
Finn : I know .
It &apos;s an obvi trap .
But wait .
What if ... watch this .
Ha !
&#91; grabs chalk and draws a bigger circle &#93; Mm ?
Jake : Dude , what are you — ?
Finn : If I extend the circle ... &#91; erases old circle &#93; farther ...
I can get closer to the magazine .
BMO : Theoretically , that is possible .
Jake : Yeah , but I &apos;m still getting a &quot; woo-jah &quot; feeling .
This seems like a bad idea .
Finn : Just have to stay inside this circle .
&#91; From an aerial view , the &quot; circle &quot; is evidently an outline of a woman . &#93;
Finn : Ha ha !
How &apos;d you do it , Rusty ?
How &apos;d you shake them otters ?
&#91; picks up magazine &#93; &#91; laughs &#93; Man , what a great ending !
&#91; laughs again , but suddenly starts gagging &#93; Jake : Finn ?
What &apos;s wrong , buddy ?
Finn : &#91; breathing strangely &#93; &#91; turns around , revealing he has transformed into a fly &#93; Jake &amp; BMO : &#91; scream &#93; Jake : Oh , Finn , you &apos;re disgusting !
&#91; Finn crouches and grunts as he sprouts two wings .
He flies up to the ceiling and spits on the floor near Jake and BMO . &#93;
Jake : Aw , that &apos;s it !
I &apos;ve had it with this ghost fly !
I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist !
BMO : Jake , I have a radical option .
I &apos;ve been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence .
Jake : What ?
BMO : It &apos;s okay !
I learned it out of a magazine .
Jake : &#91; looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling &#93; Finn ... &#91; to BMO &#93; All right .
But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost .
BMO : Tell me a joke .
Jake : Okay .
What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul ?
BMO : Kya !
&#91; punches Jake &#93; Jake : &#91; choking &#93; &#91; becomes pale and falls backwards &#93; BMO : I killed Jake !
Yay , BMO !
Ghost Jake : Whoa !
BMO , you killed me .
Whoa .
Wow .
Wow !
&#91; disappears &#93; BMO : Jake !
I can &apos;t hear you !
I will start your heart up in five minutes , okay ?
&#91; holds up fingers &#93; This many !
Jake : Okay .
Five minutes .
Whoa .
&#91; Several spirits of insects , animals , and furniture are seen . &#93;
Jake : Is this some kind of low-level dead world ?
That &apos;s a bummer .
&#91; Finn &apos;s body suddenly drops onto Jake &apos;s . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
&#91; The ghost fly flies toward him and gashes his arm . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
Oh , stuff !
Aah !
&#91; The ghost fly starts chasing Ghost Jake . &#93;
Jake : Ohh !
Ohh !
Get away !
&#91; throws a ghost cat at the ghost fly &#93; &#91; The ghost fly cuts it in half , causing it to disappear . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
You killed it !
Aah !
&#91; The ghost fly cuts a ghost table in half and continues chasing Jake . &#93;
Jake : Aah !
Aah !
Get away !
&#91; Jake continues throwing ghosts at the ghost fly , who slices each in half with his scythe .
The ghost fly then catches up with Jake and slices his lower back . &#93;
Jake : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; Floating into the kitchen , Jake trips over a cat and bumps the stove , knocking the pot of soup onto the floor .
The ghost fly charges toward Jake . &#93;
Jake : &#91; screams &#93; &#91; Just then , the ghost of the soup appears beside Jake . &#93;
Ghost Soup : Oooooo ... Ghost Fly : &#91; stops &#93; Hmm ?
Ghost Soup : Hoooooo !
&#91; The ghost fly starts slurping the ghost soup . &#93;
Jake : That &apos;s right .
You never finished the soup .
That &apos;s your unfinished business !
Ghost Fly : &#91; nodding &#93; Woo-woo .
Jake : And now that you &apos;ve finished it , you get to ascend to a glorious , new peaceful realm .
&#91; The ghost fly nods and starts shining and ascending slowly . &#93;
Jake : &#91; in awe &#93; Ahhh .
Bam !
&#91; slaps the fly to the floor , making it disappear in a cloud of smoke &#93; Shouldn &apos;t have tried to kill me , son !
&#91; blows at smoke &#93; Yes !
&#91; starts ascending and glowing &#93; What &apos;s happening ?
Oh , BMO must be bringing me back !
Yes !
Yeah , BMO !
&#91; Jake wakes up in a hospital bed . &#93;
Jake : Mm .
BMO ?
&#91; Finn and BMO run to Jake and embrace him . &#93;
Finn : Jake , I missed you , bro !
BMO : Jake !
Finn : Don &apos;t ever leave me again !
Jake : Good job , BMO !
You brought me back .
BMO : &#91; weakly &#93; Yes .
Yay , BMO .
BMO is so good .
&#91; Doctor Princess and Nurse Pound Cake are standing by with a defibrillator , having just used it on Jake . &#93;
Doctor Princess : Whew !
&#91; The episode starts with Finn , Jake , and BMO playing a game of bocce .
BMO throws a ball . &#93;
BMO : Jake , if I beat you , you have to call me &quot; sensei &quot; for a month .
Jake : Deal .
&#91; Turtle Princess goes by on a slow-moving rocket . &#93;
Turtle Princess : Hi , guys !
Finn , Jake , &amp; BMO : &apos; Sup , Turtle Princess ?
&#91; She leaves them .
Scene cuts to Lumpy Space Princess swatting bugs off of herself . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Agh !
Agh !
Agh !
Agh !
Agh !
Agh !
Get your hands off me , Steven ! !
YAH !
&#91; Throws him down &#93; And you , too , Chad !
&#91; Flicks ant away &#93; &#91; Turtle Princess enters . &#93;
Turtle Princess : Heeeey , giiiirl !
Lumpy Space Princess : Heeeey , giiiirl !
Turtle Princess : Brought you some little fruit pies .
Lumpy Space Princess : Awesome .
&#91; Starts eating &#93; Turtle Princess : How ya doin &apos; out here ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Turtle Princess , the men out here will not leave me alone !
Turtle Princess : Huh ... it must be nice .
Lumpy Space Princess : Nah .
It &apos;s horrible .
They just want me for my lumps !
&#91; Vulture screeches at them . &#93;
These lumps aren &apos;t for SALE , BILLY !
&#91; Throws fruit pie at vulture making it fly away . &#93;
&#91; To Turtle Princess &#93; Aren &apos;t you sick of men going after your turtle lumps ?
Turtle Princess : Actually , I &apos;ve never been able to work my T-lumps .
I just know what I read in books .
&#91; Gasps &#93; Hey !
You should write a book telling me how to do it !
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , my Glob !
Turtle Princess !
I &apos;ve always wanted to write trashy books for ladies !
&#91; Snake hisses at her &#93; YAH !
&#91; Hits it &#93; BACK UP OFF ME , RICKY ! !
&#91; To Turtle Princess &#93; Yeah , everyone needs to know when I work these lumps , no man is immune to their influence !
&#91; Two balls land in front of them .
Finn enters . &#93;
Finn : Jake &apos;s ball landed over here , BMO !
Turtle Princess : &#91; Gasps &#93; LSP !
Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies !
&#91; BMO and Jake enter . &#93;
BMO : Yay !
I win !
&#91; To Jake &#93; Bow to your sensei !
Jake : Aaah ... Finn : Heh heh heh heh heh heh !
Turtle Princess : &#91; To Lumpy Space Princess &#93; You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him .
Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps !
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;ll do it !
For the world !
And for you , girl !
Turtle Princess : Oh , girl !
&#91; They both smile .
Lumpy Space Princess grabs a plastic grocery bag off the ground and dons it like a spaghetti-strap dress .
Scene shifts to the Grasslands ; Lumpy Space Princess is going to the Tree Fort . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Recording herself &#93; Day one : on my way to Finn and Jake &apos;s .
Side-note : I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse .
Mm !
Mm !
Mm !
&#91; Takes out a fruit pie and &quot; puts on &quot; its custard before eating the fruit pie ; knocks on Finn and Jake &apos;s front door ; Jake answers . &#93;
Jake : Hello ?
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Seductively &#93; Heeey , Jaaaake ... Is Finn hooome ... ?
Jake : &#91; Wincing in disgust &#93; Ooh !
Finn : &apos; Sup , LSP ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , hey .
I &apos;m answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary .
Finn : Wha ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugh ...
Hold on .
I &apos;ll get it .
&#91; Starts digging through bag &#93; Hold on .
It &apos;s down in there .
Okay , wait , I got it .
Uh , here you go .
Finn : &#91; Reading fake ad &#93; &quot; WANTED — ADVENTURE SECRETARY . &quot;
&#91; Sniffs it &#93; Smells like fruit pie .
Jake : It &apos;s nice of you to wanna be our secretary ... but we don &apos;t need one .
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; Dude , look at &apos; er .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Messily slathering custard on her face &#93; Mmm ... Oh , Glob ... Finn : Yeah , it &apos;s sad .
Come on .
We &apos;ve gotta help &apos; er .
&#91; Jake hesitates speaking for a moment &#93; Jake : Alright , LSP .
Come inside .
Lumpy Space Princess : Awesome .
&#91; Recording herself &#93; Totally nailed the interview .
&#91; Licks custard off face &#93; &#91; The three walk inside . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m gonna need a secretary desk !
&#91; She immediately forces dishes off a table ( &quot; Rrr-AAAGH ! &quot; )
and puts her working equipment .
Finn and Jake just look at each other . &#93;
I &apos;m starving !
What &apos;s for dinner ? !
Finn : Oh .
Uh ... &#91; Checks fridge &#93; We got some blueberries .
Jake : Jake has saltines .
Lumpy Space Princess : Yuck .
&#91; Recording herself &#93; Looks like I &apos;ll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner .
&#91; Seductively &#93; Hey , Finn ... &#91; Rubbing her lumps &#93; You got anything better to eat ? ?
Finn : &#91; Focused on the fridge &#93; Oh , cool .
Old spaghetti .
I &apos;m gonna go heat this up .
&#91; Exits &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Recording herself &#93; Chapter 1 : &quot; Gotcha ! &quot;
&#91; Scene changes to that night . &#93;
Finn : &#91; To Lumpy Space Princess &#93; Have a good night .
See ya in the mornin &apos; .
Lumpy Space Princess : G &apos;night , you guys !
&#91; They go upstairs . &#93;
&#91; Recording herself &#93; Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought .
I guess at the end of the day , it &apos;s all about the lumps .
&#91; Her phone rings ( Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s ringtone is Turtle Princess saying , &quot; Heeey , girl ! &quot;
repeatedly ) and she answers it . &#93;
Turtle Princess : &#91; On other end &#93; Hey , girl .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , Turtle Princess !
This book is coming out awesome !
Turtle Princess : Oh , good , girl !
I can &apos;t wait to read it !
Lumpy Space Princess : Thanks , girl .
Turtle Princess : Goodnight , girl .
Lumpy Space Princess : Goodnight , girl .
&#91; Hangs up &#93; &#91; Scene shifts to the next morning .
Lumpy Space Princess wakes up grunting and drooling . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : What &apos;s that ?
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess goes outside to find Finn putting rocks in Jake . &#93;
Jake : &apos; Sup , LSP ?
Lumpy Space Princess : What &apos;re you guys doing ?
Finn : We &apos;re carrying these rocks on an adventure , up to the Mystery Mountains .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , nuh-uh , I am not gonna carry rocks !
Finn : That &apos;s okay .
Jake can carry &apos; em .
Jake : Yup .
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugh ... Fine ... &#91; Picks up two rocks &#93; You &apos;re welcome , Finn .
&#91; Finn gives a thumbs up .
The trio starts going to the mountains . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugh ... My arms weren &apos;t meant to carry so many rocks , you guys !
Finn : C &apos;mon , LSP .
You can make it .
Lumpy Space Princess : Uuoohhh ... &#91; Drops the rocks in exhaustion ; her phone rings ( &quot; Heeey , girl !
Heeey , girl ! &quot; )
and she answers . &#93;
Turtle Princess , you can &apos;t call me !
You &apos;re gonna blow my cover !
Turtle Princess : Good morning , girl .
Lumpy Space Princess : Good morning , girl .
Turtle Princess : Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy , that vulture who was hitting on you ?
I think he &apos;s cute and I would — Finn : Hey , LSP , shake a leg .
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Whisper &#93; Can &apos;t talk right now , girl !
&#91; Hangs up &#93; &#91; The trio arrives at the top of one of the mountains . &#93;
Finn : The Loch of Phantoms .
Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path .
&#91; Starts throwing rocks into the lake &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; To herself &#93; This is way too boring for my book .
&#91; Acting &#93; Oh ... my shoulder strap ... Oh , my orange juice is comin &apos; out ... Ha !
Gotch — Huh ?
&#91; Finn throws another rock in , paying no attention to her . &#93;
Finn : Haha !
Jake !
&quot; Ker-ploop . &quot;
Jake : Heh heh heh !
&quot; Ker-ploop . &quot;
Lumpy Space Princess : Not ... gotcha ?
&#91; Finn throws another rock in the lake , and the rock stays on the lake &apos;s surface . &#93;
Finn : Alright !
&#91; Finn throws a bunch more rocks in to determine which path to walk in .
The trio enters the cave opposite them .
Sludge falls on Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Ugh !
This place is plops , Finn !
Finn : We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want .
&#91; Continuing on &#93; That weird light ... &#91; The trio eventually stops in front of a strange vortex . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Hey , Finn !
Finn , my dress is slipping ! !
Finn : &#91; Not paying attention &#93; Huh ?
Listen , LSP , we &apos;ve gotta be carefu — Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Swinging around her &quot; dress &quot; &#93; Oooh , my dress ... &#91; her dress goes into the portal &#93; &#91; She drifts into the portal . &#93;
Finn : No , LSP !
It &apos;s not safe !
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess gets trapped in a room full of mirrors . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Heeeeeeey ... &#91; Noticing Finn in a mirror &#93; Oh .
Hey , Fiiiiinn ... &#91; Finn and Jake bang on the wall . &#93;
Finn : She &apos;s stuck in there !
Jake : We gotta bust through this wall !
&#91; They attack the wall . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : I knew you couldn &apos;t resist me , Finn .
&#91; The reflection of Finn takes off his hat revealing long , luscious hair . &#93;
Oh , lump .
I took it too far !
&#91; The Mirror Finns reach out for Lumpy Space Princess &#93; My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster !
Get away , Finn !
AAH , NO , AAAAAH ! ! !
&#91; Finn and Jake bust in just in time to defeat the shadow Finns . &#93;
OH , I CAN &apos;T LOOK !
&#91; Opens one eye &#93; Aah !
&#91; Finn and Jake finish defeating the shadow Finns and pant heavily . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : That was so crazy !
What just happened ? !
Finn : Oh .
Uh , Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors .
Evil stuff happens when you look into them .
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , Glob ...
I had to look because I looked so good !
Finn : LSP ... you don &apos;t need a mirror to know you look good .
&#91; Sheaths his sword and grabs Lumpy Space Princess &apos;s &quot; dress . &quot; &#93;
You &apos;re beautiful on the inside .
Like ... your brain and stuff !
Lumpy Space Princess : Thanks for sayin &apos; that stuff ... and for saving me from those mirror-yous .
That was pretty nice .
&#91; Finn smiles .
Scene shifts back to the Tree Fort . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Okay .
Time to write .
Gonna make this ... trashy .
Turtle Princess &apos;ll be all , &#91; Imitating her &#93; &quot; Oh , my gosh !
Number one best-seller ! &quot;
Hah ... Yeah .
&#91; She looks around with uncertainty and notices Finn sitting on a log outside . &#93;
&#91; To Jake &#93; What &apos;s he doing out there ?
Jake : Sometimes , after an adventure , he likes to sit out there and think .
&#91; Goes upstairs &#93; &#91; Lumpy Space Princess looks at Finn .
Her cellphone rings ( &quot; Heeey , girl !
He — &quot; ) and she answers . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Fearful &#93; Hello ?
Turtle Princess : Hey , girl .
Are you almost done with your book ?
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh ...
I &apos;m working on it !
I &apos;ve been doing so much research !
Turtle Princess : Did Finn fall victim to your lumps ?
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Prevaricating &#93; Um ... yeah ...
Turtle Princess : Great !
Bring in your manuscript right away !
Click !
&#91; Hangs up &#93; Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; To herself &#93; Yeah ... A book about how I &apos;m hot , and Finn only wants ...
He &apos;s so ... hot .
&#91; Gasps in realization and has flashbacks of Finn from earlier moments in the episode . &#93;
... Finn has the hottest lumps , but his lumps are on the inside !
YAAAAGH ! !
&#91; Pushes equipment off desk in frustration &#93; HE &apos;S GREAT !
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess begins typing a new manuscript .
As she &apos;s typing , it begins to rain , and Finn runs inside .
In response , Lumpy Space Princess hurriedly gathers up her manuscript and leaves as Finn enters . &#93;
Finn : Uh ... Bye , LSP .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Library .
Turtle Princess reads the manuscript confused . &#93;
Turtle Princess : This isn &apos;t what you said it &apos;d be about ... Lumpy Space Princess : I know , I — Turtle Princess : I LOVE IT !
Lumpy Space Princess : OH , MY GLOB !
&#91; Turtle Princess makes the cover and titles the book &quot; I Wrote a Book . &quot;
Billy screeches .
Back at the Tree Fort , the rain clears , and Lumpy Space Princess returns . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Finn !
You &apos;ve probably been wondering where I &apos;ve been for the last few hours !
Finn : Oh .
Yeah !
Yeah , I have .
Lumpy Space Princess : Finn ...
I was never really your secretary , Finn .
I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I &apos;m so hot , Finn ! !
Finn : &#91; Not seeing anything wrong with this &#93; Oh .
Okay .
Lumpy Space Princess : But you &apos;re the one who &apos;s hot , Finn ! !
Finn : Wow .
Uh , thanks !
Lumpy Space Princess : No ... thank you .
&#91; Goes over to a window and opens it to exit &#93; Jake : LSP , YOU &apos;RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES ! ! ! !
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; Whisper &#93; Gotcha ... &#91; Slowly exits and floats away from the tree house .
Her floating falters for a moment as the episode ends . &#93;
The episode begins with Finn and Jake having a picnic and watching the sunset . &#93;
Jake : Hey , man , it &apos;s Couples Only Movie Night tonight .
Who are you bringin &apos; ?
Finn : I don &apos;t know .
Who are you bringin &apos; ?
Jake : I &apos;m bringing my girlfriend , dude .
Finn : Oh .
&#91; A duck walks up to them and Finn picks it up . &#93;
Finn : I &apos;ll take this duck !
Jake : It &apos;s couples night !
You gotta bring someone you can smooch .
Finn : Man , I don &apos;t want to be smooched !
Jake : Don &apos;t have to smooch .
You just have to bring someone you can smooch .
It &apos;s , like , the rules .
Finn : Lame .
&#91; Attempts to kiss duck , but it flies away . &#93;
Ah !
Well , I &apos;ll take this blanket !
&#91; Kisses blanket . &#93;
Jake : Put the blanket down .
&#91; Pats the ground beside him . &#93;
Have a seat .
I want to explain some &quot; things &quot; to you about couples .
&#91; Later that day , Finn and Jake are back at the treehouse .
Finn is looking for someone to call . &#93;
Jake : You all square ?
Finn : Yeah , yeah .
Jake : Who you gonna call ?
Finn : I &apos;m going to call a girl I don &apos;t have to kiss .
&#91; Calls Princess Bubblegum . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Whistling as she answers the phone . &#93;
Hello ?
Finn : Hi Princess !
Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me ?
Princess Bubblegum : Sounds romantic , Finn .
Finn : No !
I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me .
&#91; Begins to blush . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : No , sorry , Finn .
I &apos;m busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship .
Finn : But — Princess Bubblegum : Auf Wiedersehen !
( &quot; Goodbye &quot; ) &#91; Hangs up phone and begins to practice her whistling . &#93;
Finn : She doesn &apos;t want to go !
Jake : Yes she does !
We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you .
&#91; Takes out cell phone . &#93;
I &apos;m calling Marceline .
Finn : What ?
Jake : &#91; Begins to call Marceline . &#93;
Look , man , I &apos;ve been learning a lot about vampires lately .
I realized my fear was based on ignorance !
&#91; Marceline answers her phone , half of the screen Jake and half the screen of Marceline . &#93;
Marceline : Speak .
Jake : Hey , hey , Marceline .
Got a favor to ask , Babe .
We &apos;ve gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous , so she &apos;ll go to the movies with Finn .
&#91; Marceline sneaks out from a pile of dirty clothes behind Jake and begins to approach him . &#93;
Marceline ?
Come in .
Hello ?
&#91; Marceline hisses loudly behind him , making Jake scream loudly . &#93;
Finn : Hehe .
Are you gonna help us ?
Marceline : Yeah , I &apos;ll help .
It &apos;ll be funny .
&#91; Now at the Candy Kingdom . &#93;
Jake : Okay , so here &apos;s the plan .
&#91; Points at Finn &#93; You start saying things and &#91; Points at Marceline &#93; you start laughing waaay loud .
And then Bubblegum ... &#91; Camera pans up to Princess Bubblegum through the window above them . &#93;
will get jealous of you &#91; Points at Marceline &#93; .
Which will awaken her Finn love !
You start us off .
Finn : Um ... hmm funny ... funny ... giddy up ?
&#91; Marceline bursts out laughing . &#93;
Finn : Hehe .
Um ... diggy diggy ?
&#91; Marceline laughs even more , very exaggerated . &#93;
Finn : Diggy diggy !
&#91; Claps hands . &#93;
Diggy diggy !
&#91; Princess Bubblegum appears at window and clears throat . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Greetings , Finn .
&#91; Unamused tone . &#93;
Hey , Marceline ... Marceline : &#91; Waves , amused tone &#93; Hello , Bonnibel .
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Still umamused &#93; Yeah , yeah .
So , what &apos;s so funny , Finn ?
Finn : I , um ... uh ... it &apos;s ... something .
Princess Bubblegum : Well , then , keep it down out there !
I &apos;m trying to whistle practice !
&#91; Walks away , whistling . &#93;
Jake : That was great !
Now , we begin Phase 2 !
It &apos;s so powerful !
Wait here !
Hehehe ... &#91; Stretches away . &#93;
Marceline : Hey , look , Finn , I know Jake &apos;s your friend and all , but ... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you , you &apos;ve gotta like , stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl !
Finn : But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful !
Marceline : &#91; Blows raspberry . &#93;
How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl ?
Finn : Yeah ... Marceline : Okay great .
So what we need now is something ... fun !
Girls love fun more than anything .
Fun , fun , fun !
If you can show Princess Bubblegum you &apos;re fun , she &apos;ll deffs wanna go to the movies with you .
Finn : Haha , you said fun so much , it sounds all weird now .
Fun .
F — Marceline : So ... what do you like to do for fun , Finn ?
Finn : Oh , Oh !
I like to wrestle !
And fight !
&#91; Makes fighting sounds &amp; positions . &#93;
But girls don &apos;t like that .
Marceline : No , no , that &apos;s perfect !
All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are .
&#91; Floats away . &#93;
Finn : Ffffffuuunnn .
Ffffuuunn .
&#91; Begins to walk after Marceline but is stopped by Jake . &#93;
Jake : Whoa , where you going , man ?
Check it out !
Finn : What is that stuff ?
Jake : It &apos;s a lute-suit !
Girls love it !
Trust me .
&#91; Now in the hallway outside of Princess Bubblegum &apos;s bedroom , Finn is dressed in the lute-suit and Jake is shaped-changed into a chair .
Marceline floats down from the ceiling . &#93;
Marceline : Finn !
What the plum are you wearing ?
You look horrible !
Jake : It &apos;s a lute-suit !
And Finn looks adorable in it !
Marceline : Well , it &apos;s going to ruin the plan .
Jake : What she talking about , Finn ?
Finn : Well ...
I was going to give Marceline &apos;s plan a try , too .
Jake : Her idea ? !
What &apos;s wrong with my idea ?
&#91; Marceline flicks her tongue at Jake . &#93;
&#91; Princess Bubblegum is heard whistling and walks into the hallway , Jake turns back into a chair and Marceline turns into a bat and flies away . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Whistles . &#93;
Oh , hey , Finn !
Did &apos;ya ever find some — Whoa !
What are you wearing ?
Finn : Oh ... this is my ... Lute ... suit .
&#91; Jake points down at lute he stretched and motions for him to play it . &#93;
Finn : Oh .
&#91; Singing and playing the lute . &#93;
This is my lute-suit !
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Starts to laugh . &#93;
Finn , that is hilarious !
&#91; Starts to laugh again . &#93;
Oh , you are killing me !
&#91; Giggles . &#93;
Marcelince : Psst !
&#91; Still a bat and flying near the ceiling , makes wresting motions and noises . &#93;
Finn : Oh , yeah !
&#91; Puts lute on chair-Jake . &#93;
So ... Headlock !
&#91; Puts Princess Bubblegum in a headlock and she falls to the ground screaming . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Guards !
&#91; Finn is thrown out of the castle .
Jake comes out of the hole in the lute , breaking the strings and falls , dizzy .
Marceline sits down next to him and turns back to normal . &#93;
Marceline : That suit was ridiculous .
Jake : Ridi — Ridiculous ?
What ?
Can you believe this girl , Finn ?
Huh ?
Can ya ?
Finn : Uh ...
I guess the suit did feel ... a little silly .
Jake : Well , fine !
You can just give it back then !
&#91; Finn take off suit . &#93;
Finn : I &apos;m sorry !
Jake : Good luck getting to that movie without my help !
Ruff .
&#91; Stretches away . &#93;
Marceline : Gee , he seems pretty ticked .
Finn : Naw , he just needs some spaghetti .
Marceline : Oh , okay .
Well taste this , then .
I &apos;ve gotta a new plan .
Finn : Really ?
Marceline : The only thing women like more than fun is excitement !
She needs to feel her blood pump , man !
She needs to ... be chased by wolves !
Finn : Like metaphorically ?
Marceline : Come on , I &apos;ll teach ya how to show a girl a good time .
Wraps Finn &apos;s arms around her . &#93;
Hold tight .
You ready ?
Finn : Uhh ... &#91; Holds tighter . &#93;
Mhmm .
&#91; Marceline takes off and laughs .
They fly above a pack of running wolves and start to run with them .
Marceline stops and growls at Finn until he begins to growl back and run on all fours .
Finn &amp; Marceline begin to run with the wolves , foam coming out of Finn &apos;s mouth and howl at the moon with them .
Marceline bites the back of the wolf in front of her and Finn does the same .
Finn and Marceline begin to ride on the back of two wolves .
Marceline and Finn fly two wolves to the Candy Kingdom and outside of Princess Bubblegum &apos;s room . &#93;
Marceline : Shhh !
She &apos;s probably asleep !
&#91; They put the wolves into Princess Bubblegum &apos;s room and close the door . &#93;
Finn : This was a really good idea .
Marceline : &#91; Turns into a bat . &#93;
Now don &apos;t blow it this time !
Finn : Haha , okay .
&#91; Princess Bubblegum screams , runs out of her room and struggles to close the door behind her .
She notices Finn . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : Oh , Finn , thank goodness you &apos;re here !
There &apos;s wolves in my room !
Finn : Yeah , I know !
I put them there !
Pretty exciting , right ?
Heh heh .
&#91; Banana Guards drag Finn out of the castle . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : &#91; Sadly &#93; I &apos;m sorry to do this , Finn .
But until you stop acting like a psycho , you &apos;re forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom .
Farewell .
&#91; Walks back into the castle , a pretzel gate sliding closed behind her .
A duck quacks , and poos on him . &#93;
Finn : I don &apos;t understand , Marceline .
I tried everything .
I guess she just doesn &apos;t like me .
&#91; Marceline puts a finger to his lips . &#93;
Marceline : Shhh .
Come on , Finn , a brainlord like Bonnie ?
You &apos;ll be bored with her in a week !
And anyway I , for one , think you &apos;re pretty great .
&#91; Kisses Finn on the cheek . &#93;
Sorry it didn &apos;t work out the way you wanted .
See you later , I guess !
&#91; Flies away . &#93;
Finn : Marceline !
Of course !
It &apos;s been Marceline all along !
Jake : Hey , man , I &apos;ve been looking for you .
Sorry for acting like a dweeb before .
Want some leftover spaghetti ?
Finn : Ah , no , thanks , man .
But I really need your help !
Jake : &apos; Bout time !
&#91; Marceline is at her house and is about to play her bass , when she hears a lute playing outside .
She looks out the window and she &apos;s Finn dressed in the lute-suit . &#93;
Marceline : Uh-oh .
Finn : &#91; Makes guitar noises . &#93;
Marceline !
Will you go to the movies with me ? !
&#91; Marceline opens door . &#93;
Marceline : We need to talk ... &#91; Finn and Jake walk in . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Singing &#93; Good evening my dear , your escort is here !
Marceline : Finn , you do NOT want to go down that road with me .
Finn : With you , I would walk down any road , m &apos;lady .
Especially , if it leads to the movies .
Marceline : Oh , yeah ?
No one would want to go to the movies with ... &#91; Turns into a giant tenctacle monster &#93; this !
&#91; Laughs evilly and picks up Finn . &#93;
What do you think of me now ?
Finn : How do you like your popcorn ?
Marceline : Uuugh !
&#91; Turns back to normal . &#93;
You &apos;re starting to annoy me !
Finn : Well then let &apos;s do something fun , like go to the movies !
Marceline : Get off me !
&#91; Throws Finn onto her couch and floats down beside him while Jake is hiding behind the couch &#93; Finn , I like you , but I — Finn : Headlock !
&#91; Puts Marceline in headlock . &#93;
Marceline : No !
&#91; Pushes Finn off &#93; Listen to me .
I &apos;m not going to go to the movies with you !
I just don &apos;t like you ... that way .
&#91; Finn lies down on the couch , sad . &#93;
Marceline : I &apos;m sorry Finn , I just ...
I don &apos;t wanna date you .
Finn : Date me ?
Man , I just wanna go to the movies .
But everybody hates me .
Marceline : Wait , you don &apos;t want me to be your girlfriend ?
Finn : Huh ?
No !
Movies !
Marceline : If you weren &apos;t looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day ?
Finn : &apos; Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else .
Jake : I didn &apos;t really say all that .
&#91; Mumbles something and hides behind couch . &#93;
Marceline : Of course I &apos;ll go with you , Finn !
Finn : You will ?
Marceline : Yeah , as friends .
Finn : Of course as friends !
Marceline : But no tongue .
Finn : Yea — Wha ?
&#91; Marceline and Finn are at Couples Movie Night , sitting on an old truck and watching the intros . &#93;
Finn and Marceline : &#91; Both laughing excitedly &#93; Finn : Oh , man !
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m finally going to see this movie !
&#91; The movie &quot; Love Kaboom &quot; starts with a woman and man . &#93;
Woman in movie : Oh , mon cher .
I guess zese is goodbye .
&#91; Finn is getting weirded out by the movie . &#93;
Man in movie : No , not goodbye .
Let &apos;s say : Farewell !
&#91; Jake and Lady Rainicorn , Lollipop Girl &amp; Ice Cream Guy are kissing , and so are two bugs in Ice Cream Guy &apos;s head .
Finn sees all of this and throws up and turns to Marceline , who is also grossed out . &#93;
Finn : Couples Night sucks !
Marceline , would you do me the honor , of getting the plop out of here ?
Marceline : There &apos;s nothing I &apos;d like more .
&#91; Pushes Finn off the truck they are sitting on and flies up . &#93;
Man in movie : Nothing can ever tear us apart .
&#91; Finn tears through the screen and rides off with Marceline on running wolves . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn walking through some bushes , looking for Jake . &#93;
Finn : &#91; calling &#93; Jake !
Jake !
&#91; coming out of bushes &#93; Jake ?
&#91; sees Jake &apos;s viola resting on a rock &#93; Hmmm ... &#91; picks it up and starts playing it poorly &#93; Jake : &#91; off screen &#93; Aaaah !
&#91; comes out of bushes covering his ears &#93; Aaaaah !
&#91; rolls on ground &#93; Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl !
&#91; gets up and knocks the viola out of Finn &apos;s hands &#93; Uh !
That sounded horrible , man !
&#91; picks up viola &#93; Finn : I don &apos;t know how to play .
Jake : Exactly !
&#91; starts tuning viola &#93; &#91; Distant screams are heard off screen . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Let &apos;s go !
&#91; runs toward screaming &#93; Jake : Oh , wait up .
I gotta finish tuning my viola .
&#91; Scene changes to Finn running toward the Soft Village .
He enters it and sees several Soft People crying . &#93;
Finn : Soft People !
Why are you all in a tizzy ?
Soft Person # 1 : The Gut Grinder !
He &apos;s back !
Finn : The &quot; Gut Grinder ? &quot;
Old Soft Person : Yes , the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster .
In the past , the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it .
It was awesome &#91; laughs &#93; !
But then , the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold .
So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup .
And it worked !
The Gut Grinder didn &apos;t come back !
But recently , and admittedly it was probably a bad idea , we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town .
Haha , &apos; cause-- &apos; cause we really like dancing around it !
But , boy oh boy , was that a mistake .
You know what happened ?
Finn : Uhhh ... it came back and ate all your gold ?
Old Soft Person : &#91; crying &#93; Yes , oh , yes !
Finn : Aw , don &apos;t cry , Soft Old Man .
I &apos;ll find this monster and bring peace to this village .
I swear !
Soft Person # 1 : Swear to what ?
Finn : I swear to justice !
Soft People : Whoa !
He swears to justice !
Finn : Okay , so , what does he look like ?
Old Soft Person : Ohh , it &apos;s so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks .
But ... &#91; walks over to footprint &#93; he left this footprint ... &#91; Jake ( giant-sized ) storms in &#93; Wha-- ?
Jake : &#91; putting his foot in the print &#93; Yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo , yo !
Soft Person # 1 : Look !
His paw matches the footprint !
&#91; Soft People start murmuring , terrified . &#93;
Soft Person # 1 : I &apos;m so scared , I &apos;m gonna go wee-wee !
Finn : Whoa , no , no-no-no-no !
Calm down , everybody .
This is my friend , Jake the Dog .
Soft Person # 2 : &#91; sigh &#93; Thank goodness .
Soft Person # 1 : Yeah--I almost wee-wee &apos;d !
Jake : Wait , you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder ?
Soft Person # 1 : Oh , yeah !
We &apos;re terrified of him .
Jake : &#91; loudly &#93; Then I am the Gut Grinder !
Soft Person # 1 : I &apos;m gonna wee-wee !
&#91; squirts liquid out of its armpits and spins around in a circle &#93; Finn : &#91; laugh &#93; That guy wee-wees weird .
Jake : I &apos;m just kiddin &apos; , everybody .
I &apos;m not the Gut Grinder .
I &apos;m ... &#91; shrinks back to normal size &#93; Jake the Dog !
Woohoo !
Soft Person # 3 : Aw , he &apos;s just a cute little dog !
Jake : Hey , I &apos;m not cute !
Soft Child : &#91; running up to Jake &#93; Doggy !
&#91; petting Jake &#93; Pet , pet , pet !
&#91; laughs &#93; Jake : Huh ?
Oh , heheh .
&#91; closes his eyes , purrs , drools &#93; Finn : Pfft .
Jake : What ? !
Finn : I didn &apos;t say anything .
&#91; to villagers &#93; People of the village of Soft People , I , Finn , and my buddy Jake , will find this monstrous monster and slay it !
&#91; Soft People cheer . &#93;
Finn : Come on , let &apos;s go , Jake .
Jake : &#91; getting a belly rub &#93; Oh ... heheh .
What ?
No !
&#91; Finn grabs him and drags him away &#93; Noooo ... Soft Child : Bye-bye , doggy !
Jake : &#91; still being dragged by Finn &#93; Bye , Soft Village .
&#91; Scene changes to Finn and Jake following the footprints .
Jake is walking in them . &#93;
Jake : Hey Finn , my feet fit these prints pretty well .
Hm , what if I really am the Gut Grinder ?
&#91; laughs nervously &#93; Finn : Dude , your paws &apos;ll fit anything .
Jake : &#91; laugh &#93; That is true .
Check this out .
&#91; shrinks his feet to fit Finn &apos;s prints and walks in them ; says mockingly : &#93; I &apos;m Finn the Human and I stink at viola !
Finn : &#91; imitating Jake &#93; I &apos;m Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop .
Jake : There &apos;s a lot of interesting smells in poop .
&#91; Commotion is heard in the distance . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
&#91; sees that it &apos;s coming from Cube Village &#93; &#91; Scene switches to Finn inside Cube Village . &#93;
Finn : Hey Cube People , what &apos;s going on here ?
Cube Person # 1 : The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold !
Jake : &#91; emerging from behind a building &#93; Wait , what happened ?
Cube People : Aaah !

Finn : Whoa , no , no , no !
He &apos;s not the Gut Grinder !
He &apos;s my friend !
Cube Person # 2 : We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him !
Jake : &#91; laughs nervously &#93; Th-that &apos;s ridiculous .
Finn : Jake , back to your normal size .
Jake : Oh yeah .
&#91; shrinks down , starts dancing &#93; Ooh ooh ooh .
&#91; sings &#93; I am not ... the Gut Grinder .
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh .
Cube Person # 1 : Aw , he &apos;s just a cute little dog .
Jake : Hey !

Jake : &#91; getting belly rubbed &#93; Ruff , ruff , grrrr ... &#91; continues making dog sounds &#93; Finn : Huh ...
Which way did he go ?
&#91; Cube People point left . &#93;
Finn : Jake !
Hey , come on !
Jake : Wha-- ?

Finn : &#91; running left &#93; Thanks , guys !
Jake : &#91; following Finn &#93; I &apos;m not cute .
I &apos;ll mess you up .
&#91; Scene changes to Finn riding Jake through a field . &#93;
Jake : Finn ... ?
What if I am the Gut Grinder ?
Finn : What ? !
Jake : What if I &apos;m , like , stealing gold in my sleep ?
Finn : You can &apos;t be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep .
Jake : Wha-- ?
Yo , Finn , that is creepy , man .
Finn : I can &apos;t help it .
I take pictures .
Jake : Well , when do you sleep ?
Finn : Justice never sleeps .
Jake : Well , there &apos;s gotta be a time when you &apos;re not watchin &apos; me ... that--that I--that I might be stealin &apos; gold unconsciously !
Finn : &#91; into Jake &apos;s ear &#93; You ... are ... not ... the ...
Gut ... Grinder !
Jake : &#91; worried moan &#93; &#91; An alarm starts sounding .
Finn and Jake see that it is coming from the Spiky Village . &#93;
Alarm : City in danger !
City in danger !
Finn : Let &apos;s go !
Oh , wait--what if these guys think you &apos;re the Gut Grinder ?
Hmm ... &#91; snaps fingers &#93; Ah-ha !
&#91; reaches into his pack &#93; Got the perfect thing for ya : &#91; pulls out glasses &#93; Groucho glasses !
&#91; places glasses on a lump of Jake &apos;s fat &#93; Jake : I love it !
&#91; kisses lump , hides his face by moving it to his chest &#93; Launch in 3 , 2 , 1 !
&#91; jumps toward Spiky Village &#93; Finn : Woohoo !
Yeah !
&#91; They enter Spiky Village .
Several Spiky People are seen crying . &#93;
Finn : Oh , man !
These people are a mess !
Spiky Guard : Halt !
Identify yourselves immediately !
Finn : I am Finn the hero !
Jake : &#91; moving lump &#93; I &apos;m Groucho !
Finn : We &apos;re on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder .
Spiky Guards : &#91; gasp &#93; Spiky Mayor : I am the mayor of this village .
Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of .
Finn : I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back !
Spiky Mayor : Our people thank you .
I present to you this photo &#91; Spiky Person enters carrying a photograph &#93; of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission .
Finn : &#91; takes photo &#93; Oh , thanks .
Jake : &#91; quietly &#93; Wha-- ?
&#91; looking at photo &#93; Finn , it &apos;s me !
Finn : &#91; crumbles photo into a ball ; says quietly : &#93; Well , duh , it looks like you .
&#91; puts photo in pocket &#93; We already knew that .
It &apos;s just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face .
Jake : Yeah , I-I know you think it does , Finn--but this is different .
I &apos;m scared , Finn .
&#91; starts shaking nervously &#93; Finn : Jake , stop it !
&#91; Jake accidentally shakes off the Groucho glasses . &#93;
Spiky Mayor : Wha-- ?
Oh , it &apos;s the Gut Grinder !
&#91; Spiky People start murmuring angrily and surround Finn and Jake . &#93;
Finn : No , no-no-no-no !
He &apos;s not the Gut Grinder !
I swear on my good name ... and justice ... and Jake &apos;s cute face !
&#91; Jake bats his eyelids . &#93;
Spiky Mayor : His face is weird .
The truth is obvious : your friend is the Gut Grinder !
&#91; Spiky People take Jake . &#93;
Finn : NOOOOOO !
Spiky Mayor : &#91; as Spiky People put Jake in jail . &#93;
You are under arrest for stealing our gold .
Finn : &#91; running up to Jake &#93; I &apos;ll get you out of here ... somehow .
Jake : No , Finn ...
I belong behind bars .
Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder .
Finn : Buddy , listen to me .
You &apos;ve been my best friend for as long as I can remember !
That &apos;s enough evidence to prove to me that you &apos;re not a monster !
Jake : Then ... why am I in jail ?
Only Gut Grinders go to jail .
Old Man Prisoner : I &apos;m in jail and I &apos;m not the Gut Grinder .
&#91; catches a grub &#93; I &apos;m here for the free grub .
&#91; puts grub in his mouth &#93; Hehehehehe !
&#91; his gold tooth gleams &#93; Finn : Huh ?
Wait , I got an idea !
&#91; Finn reaches through the bars and pulls out the old man &apos;s tooth and runs to the middle of town , holding up the tooth . &#93;
Finn : Hey , Gut Grinder !
I got some gold here that you missed .
Come and get it !
&#91; A manhole cover rattles nearby .
Out pops a cute dog face . &#93;
Finn : Huh .
Whoa , you &apos;re the Gut Grinder ?
&#91; The face shoots out sharp points and rises up .
It turns out to be a mace held by the Gut Grinder , who climbs out of the manhole .
The Gut Grinder growls and sees the gold tooth in Finn &apos;s hand .
He chases Finn , punches him , and steps on him , taking the tooth and laughing .
The scene switches to inside the jail . &#93;
Old Man Prisoner : &#91; rubbing Jake &apos;s belly &#93; Oh , Gut Grinder .
Oh , Gut Grinder ... you &apos;re a little cutesy .
You &apos;re a little cutesy-wootsy .
Jake : Huh ?
Grrrr ... not cute .
&#91; thinking &#93; Am I the Gut Grinder ?
&#91; looks through bars at Gut Grinder stepping on Finn &#93; All the clues fit !
&#91; sees gold tooth &#93; I must be the Gut Grinder !
&#91; as Gut Grinder , aloud &#93; And I want GOLD !
&#91; Jake grows huge , breaks out of jail , runs over to the Gut Grinder and kicks him , sending the gold tooth into the air . &#93;
Finn : &#91; catching tooth &#93; Woohoo !
Yeah !
We got him !
Thanks for saving me , Jake !
Jake : &#91; as Gut Grinder &#93; Grrrr !
I &apos;m not Jake--I &apos;m the Gut Grinder !
Now give me that gold tooth !
Finn : What ?
Jake ?
&#91; Jake chomps at him &#93; Whoa !
&#91; Finn runs away and accidentally rips his pack on a spike , spilling its contents .
Jake corners him . &#93;
Finn : &#91; panting &#93; Whoa !
Jake : &#91; as Gut Grinder &#93; Rawr !
Now give me that tooth !
Finn : If I give you this stupid tooth , will you stop being a crazy jerk ? !
Jake : &#91; snatches tooth , tosses it into his mouth , and laughs while walking away &#93; Finn : What the-- ?
Jake !
You never turn into a monster when I want you to .
It &apos;s always , &quot; Not now , Finn .
I have a headache . &quot;
Oh , Jake , &#91; picks up viola &#93; your viola is all I have now .
&#91; plays it screechily &#93; Jake : &#91; as Gut Grinder &#93; Huh ?
&#91; comes back &#93; Ah , stay away from my viola !
Finn : Jake , you remember your viola !
Jake : &#91; as Gut Grinder &#93; I also remember that you stink hard at playing it .
And dookie is radical , man !
I don &apos;t care what anyone says .
&#91; shakes head ; normal voice &#93; Wha--huh ?
What ?
Where am I ?
Finn , is that you ?
Finn : Who else would it be , baby ?
Jake : Whoo !
&#91; shrinks to normal size &#93; I guess I went nuts .
Finn : You were so crazy , man !
Like--like , actually crazy .
Jake : &#91; burps up tooth , laughs &#93; Finn : &#91; patting Jake &apos;s back &#93; It &apos;s good to have you back .
Jake : It &apos;s good to have you pat my back .
Finn : &#91; scratching Jake &#93; Man , if I had known you were so easily manipulated , I would have eaten more of your ice cream .
Jake : &#91; pushes Finn away &#93; Cut it out !
&#91; Scene changes to Gut Grinder .
Spiky People surround it . &#93;
Spiky Person : Cut open the Gut Grinder &apos;s belly !
&#91; Something starts moving inside the Gut Grinder .
It rips open and gold spills out . &#93;
Spiky Mayor : What the-- ?
&#91; Sharon comes out of the pile of gold &#93; What the-- ?
Sharon , what are you doing in the Gut Grinder ?
Spiky People : &#91; murmuring &#93; That &apos;s the mayor &apos;s wife !
Spiky Mayor : &#91; holding skin &#93; And the Gut Grinder &apos;s skin is not skin at all--it &apos;s cloth !
Sharon !
Have you been sewing ? !
Sharon : &#91; unapologetically &#93; Yes , Cameron .
I &apos;ve been stealing gold .
Spiky Mayor : WHY , SHARON ? !
Sharon : Because I like to buy things , Cameron !
I like to shop !
And I dressed up like Jake because I think he &apos;s hot .
&#91; Spiky People gasp .
Jake raises his eyebrows up and down . &#93;
Spiky Mayor : You have been a naughty girl , Sharon .
&#91; turns to guards &#93; Guards !
Throw my wife in jail .
&#91; turns to Finn and Jake &#93; Finn and Jake , thank you for saving my Spiky Village .
Finn : &#91; gives thumbs up &#93; No problem , mayor .
Spiky Mayor : Now give us a hug .
&#91; Spiky People laugh and advance toward Finn and Jake . &#93;
Finn : No , don &apos;t do that !
Don &apos;t hug us !
&#91; Spiky People start hugging &#93; Don &apos;t touch me !
AAAAAAAAAH !
Jake : Ow !
Hey !
Don &apos;t touch us !
OWWWW !
&#91; The episode opens with Finn and Jake standing on an abandoned highway .
Jake stretches himself and Finn down , and they enter a cave . &#93;
Finn : Man , I still can &apos;t believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature .
This movie is gonna blow their minds .
&#91; Marceline opens the door . &#93;
Finn : Marceline !
We brought Heat Signature .
Marceline : Woot !
Woot !
Jake : Woo !
&#91; Finn and Jake enter the house .
A trio of ghosts float in the living room . &#93;
Marceline : Hey , so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake .
They aren &apos;t ... completely lame .
Finn : Whatup ?
Marceline : Guys , this is Wendy ... Wendy : Hey .
Marceline : Booboo ... Booboo : Hello .
Hello .
Marceline : ... and Georgy .
Georgy : Hey .
Marceline : We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld .
Finn : Hmm .
Yeah , that &apos;s pretty sweet .
Hope y &apos;all like getting your minds blown , cause it &apos;s showtime .
&#91; Finn and Jake jump backwards onto the couch , and find out that it &apos;s hard as a rock . &#93;
Finn : &#91; groans in pain &#93; What is wrong with this couch ?
Jake : Ehh , that made my teeth hurt .
Marceline : Oh yeah .
Sorry , I don &apos;t ever really sit on there .
I just float usually .
We ... kinda all do .
Finn : Aww , what ?
man , no fair .
Marceline : Yeah , well , too bad you &apos;re not vampires .
So , anyways , I ... Finn : Wait !
Hold on just a second .
&#91; Jake and Finn start whispering to each other . &#93;
Finn : Marceline , we insist you turn us into vampires .
Or ghosts , or whatever .
We just wanna fly .
Marceline : All right , all right .
Fine .
Finn and Jake : Yes !
Wendy : Come on , Marceline !
you &apos;re gonna turn these goofballs ?
Marceline : &#91; giggles &#93; Don &apos;t worry , I &apos;ve got something more fun in mind .
&#91; She whispers to the ghosts .
Finn and Jake are exhausted from jumping up and down . &#93;
Finn : Okay , Marceline , we &apos;re ready now .
Marceline : Okay , hold that thought .
&#91; She floats into the next room . &#93;
Georgy : Huhuuuhhuh ... &#91; Marceline floats back into the living room . &#93;
Marceline : I &apos;m gonna perform the biting ritual .
You guys close your eyes and don &apos;t open them until I say so .
If you do ... your heads will EXPLODE !
Okay , Finn .
You first .
&#91; Marceline lifts up Finn &apos;s hat , to reveal his neck .
She then makes a hissing noise as she moves closer .
Then she pinches Finn &apos;s neck .
Finn lets out a screech . &#93;
Marceline : Bite .
&#91; Then Marceline does the same thing to Jake . &#93;
Marceline : Chomp .
&#91; Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo all giggle .
Marceline puts a dab of ketchup on two of her fingertips and touches Finn and Jake so it looks like they &apos;ve actually been bitten . &#93;
Marceline : Boop boop .
Boop .
Boop .
Okey dokey .
All done .
How do you guys feel ?
Finn : Pretty ... much ... the same .
Jake : My neck sort of hurts .
Booboo : Don &apos;t you feel a little hungry ... for blood ?
Finn : &#91; moaning &#93; I felt it .
Jake , do you feel it ?
Jake : Yeah , I could go for some blood .
&#91; Marceline and her ghostly buddies are all snickering in the background . &#93;
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; Oh no .
Jake .
Now we &apos;re gonna have to drink blood for all eternity .
Jake : &#91; gasps &#93; Yeah , what if we turn evil ?
I &apos;ll hafta start wearing cologne .
&#91; Marceline floats by , carrying two apples . &#93;
Marceline : Relax , guys .
You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing .
Look .
&#91; She drains the red from the apple until it is pale . &#93;
You just eat the color .
Here , Jake .
You try .
&#91; She hands the other apple to Jake . &#93;
&#91; Jake bites the apple , but gets mush all over himself and Finn . &#93;
Finn : Ugh .
Come on .
Jake : Sorry , bro .
&#91; While Finn and Jake aren &apos;t looking , Marceline silently drains the red from the apple in Jake &apos;s hands .
After Jake and Finn finish rubbing the mush off their faces , Jake looks down and notices the now-pale fruit . &#93;
Oh , snap !
I feel ... stronger .
&#91; Jake squeezes the pale apple between his hands . &#93;
Finn : Whooooa ... Marceline , can we float now ?
Marceline : Mmm ... Not yet .
That &apos;s a really advanced power .
First , you gotta go through vampire orientation .
Georgy : Huhuuuhhuh ... &#91; Everyone else glares at Georgy .
His cheeks flush . &#93;
Marceline : Think you chumps can handle it ?
Finn and Jake : Oh , baby , yeah , baby , baby , baby , yeah , baby , yeah , yeah .
&#91; The scene cuts to everyone standing outside in a forest at night . &#93;
Marceline : Okay , guys , the first phase of vampire orientation is learning ... &#91; Catches a firefly and puts it in her mouth . &#93;
... invisibility .
&#91; She turns invisible .
Finn reaches out to touch the firefly in her mouth and chuckles nervously &#93; Finn : &#91; nervous chuckle &#93; Marceline : Ah !
Hey !
&#91; She slaps Finn but catches him before he hits the ground .
Marceline moves Finn around .
She becomes visible once again . &#93;
Marceline : You ready for the power of ... invisibility ?
Finn : With all my heart .
Marceline : Good .
Now , spin !
&#91; Marceline sends Finn spinning around until he falls to the ground , feeling dizzy .
Jake laughs . &#93;
Marceline : Give it a whirl , Jake !
&#91; Then she sends Jake spinning until he falls to the ground . &#93;
Now chant , &quot; INVISIBLE ! INVISIBLE ! &quot;
Finn and Jake : INVISIBLE ! INVISIBLE !
&#91; They spin to a stop .
They get up groaning dizzily . &#93;
Marceline : Yup .
It worked ?
Finn and Jake : &#91; gasp &#93; Jake : We &apos;re invisible !
&#91; He punches Finn in the stomach . &#93;
Finn : You &apos;re invisible !
&#91; He punches Jake in the stomach . &#93;
Jake : Hey .
Then how come we can see each other ?
Marceline : Because you guys become vampires at the same time .
So you are forever linked .
Finn and Jake : AWW YEAH !
&#91; They do a stomach five , and spin around , laughing . &#93;
Booboo : &#91; laughs &#93; Marceline ... you &apos;re friends with some real morons .
&#91; Georgy and Wendy grimace . &#93;
&#91; Finn and Jake happen upon a place deep in the woods where Lumpy Space Princess is camping out . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , my glob , Melissa .
Ever since Clara stopped eating meat , her skin looks so good .
I mean , she still looks fat , but like , I can &apos;t say that junk to her face .
Jake : Wow !
LSP &apos;s a hobo !
Finn : Let &apos;s mess with her .
Lumpy Space Princess : I &apos;m doing so awesome on my own .
Like , right now , I found this can of beans .
&#91; Finn and Jake start making moaning sounds , while picking up some of LSP &apos;s camping supplies . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Finn ?
Jake !
Put down my stuff !
Finn : &#91; gasps &#93; She knows it &apos;s us .
Jake : She must recognize our voices .
Finn : Let &apos;s disguise them .
&#91; Romanian accent &#93; We &apos;re invisible !
&#91; Finn and Jake continue to mess around the campsite . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Melissa , I have to go .
They got into my toilet paper .
Melissa , I have to go !
&#91; hangs up &#93; &#91; Marceline , Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo are all watching close by .
They start to snicker as they do .
LSP starts chasing them . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Give it back , you guys !
Jake : Weeeee !
&#91; He lets loose a roll of toilet paper , and it wraps around Finn &apos;s eyes , blindfolding him . &#93;
Finn : Yeah !
Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Yeah , Jake !
&#91; Because Finn is blindfolded , he can &apos;t see where he &apos;s going , and his foot unintentionally knocks into the can of baked beans . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : &#91; in slow motion &#93; Nooooooooo !
&#91; Time seems to pass in slow motion as the baked beans spill all over the ground . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : MY BEANS ! ! !
&#91; Angrily , she hits Finn and Jake .
Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo laugh at the sight . &#93;
Booboo : Time to join in on the fun !
Lumpy Space Princess : You guys ruined everything !
I &apos;m gonna kill you !
Finn : But we &apos;re undead .
&#91; An axe suddenly appears to float in midair .
LSP suddenly gasps and faints at the sight . &#93;
Jake : Geez , we really scared her .
&#91; Finn and Jake gasp as Marceline appears behind them . &#93;
Marceline : Nice vampire scare , guys .
Finn : Thanks .
&#91; Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo appear . &#93;
Booboo : Yeah , pretty good , fellas .
&#91; The ghosts chuckle . &#93;
You guys ready ... for the next vampire lesson ?
&#91; They all stick out what would be a foot .
Marceline stares . &#93;
Finn : You know we are .
Booboo : Good .
&#91; The ghosts all start kicking Finn and Jake . &#93;
Finn : Ow !
What &apos;s the point of this lesson ?
Georgy : Kick &apos; em harder !
&#91; They do so .
Bruises appear on Finn and Jake as they yelp in pain . &#93;
Finn : Ow !
It hurts !
Jake : Ohhh !
&#91; Marceline decides she &apos;s had enough . &#93;
Marceline : Okay , everyone !
Stop the toughness lesson !
Georgy : What ?
Marceline : Finn , Jake .
You guys okay ?
&#91; Finn and Jake are all covered in bumps and bruises . &#93;
Finn : We &apos;re okay .
&#91; coughs &#93; It &apos;s all worth it .
Georgy : See ?
They &apos;re fine .
Wendy : When did you go all soft ?
You used to like teaching people about kicks .
&#91; Marceline stares . &#93;
Georgy : Hey , guys , I think you &apos;re ready to learn how to float .
All you have to do is jump off that ledge .
&#91; He glances up towards some derelict structures in the distance . &#93;
Finn : Cool .
Marceline : &#91; gasps &#93; W-wait !
There &apos;s more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating .
Like ... uh ... the spooky vampire walk .
See ?
Spoooooky ... wooo !
Finn : Heh heh .
No way .
Jake : We wanna fly !
&#91; The ghosts take them away .
Marceline growls in anger and floats after them . &#93;
Marceline : You guys stop right now .
Georgy : Marceline , chill out .
It &apos;s going to be okay .
We &apos;ve got a plan .
&#91; to Finn and Jake &#93; Now , get in your flying positions .
&#91; Georgy pushes them off the edge . &#93;
Finn and Jake : VAMPIRES FOREVER ! ! !
WOOO !
Marceline : What are you guys waiting for ?
You said you had a plan .
Wendy : We do .
It &apos;s to let them die !
&#91; The ghosts start laughing . &#93;
&#91; Marceline is furious .
Her eyes blaze with rage .
Then she dives off the edge after Finn and Jake , turns invisible , and catches them just before they land on some jagged glass at the bottom .
Finn and Jake cheer on all the while .
Marceline , still unseen , drops the two of them safely on the ground . &#93;
Finn and Jake : We did it !
Yeah !
Woohoo !
Awesome !
&#91; Marceline turns visible again .
The ghosts float up to her looking not too satisfied . &#93;
Wendy : Way to go , Marceline .
Marceline : Hey , you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends !
Booboo : They gotta die someday .
Wendy : Hey !
Let &apos;s invite them to our place !
When they show up ... Wendy , Booboo and Georgy : We &apos;ll suck their guts out through their brains !
&#91; Marceline and the ghosts float over to Finn and Jake . &#93;
Finn : Did you see us ?
Wendy : Yeah , you guys were pretty amazing .
Booboo : Hey , we &apos;re gonna throw a party ... in honor of your new vampire skills .
Finn : Holy snaps , that &apos;s awesome !
Marceline : They &apos;re lying to you guys .
They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head .
Finn , Jake , and ghosts : What ?
Booboo : She &apos;s just jealous of you .
&#91; Wendy hands Finn and Jake an envelope . &#93;
Wendy : We &apos;ll see you at midnight at our place .
&#91; The ghosts turn invisible .
Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline . &#93;
Marceline : Guys , promise me you &apos;re going to that party .
Finn : We &apos;re not gonna go .
Marceline : You &apos;re not ?
Finn : Nah .
I &apos;m kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day .
We &apos;re just gonna chill .
Marceline : Oh .
Okay .
Finn : Well , we &apos;re going back home .
Jake : Peace .
&#91; The scene transitions to Jake and Finn standing in the Spooky Forest .
Lightning flashes across the night sky .
A run-down manor stands on top of the hill . &#93;
Finn : Number 25 , Blood Drive .
&#91; Finn and Jake enter the mansion . &#93;
Hey guys , we &apos;re here !
Wow !
Look at you guys !
That &apos;s awesome !
&#91; Georgy , Wendy , and Booboo have changed .
They have significantly increased in size , are wearing laced collars , and have menacing eyes and puckered lips .
Georgy closes the door .
Then the ghosts join hands , spin around our heroes , and start chanting ominously .
Their eyes and mouths start glowing white . &#93;
Finn : Uh ... &#91; He shrieks in horror as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head .
Jake tries to punch the ghosts &apos; mouths away , but one gets him from behind . &#93;
Georgy , what &apos;s wrong ?
Jake , what &apos;s happening ?
Jake : I think they &apos;re testing our vampire abilities .
Finn : Oh , sweet .
VAMPIRE KICK !
&#91; Finn leaps in the air , but gets knocked away and lands on top of the chandelier . &#93;
Georgy : Aw , come on .
Will you knock it off already ?
Wendy : You know you &apos;re not even real vampires .
Finn : Pssh .
Then why am I flying , Wendy ?
&#91; realizes &#93; Oh .
&#91; The chandelier breaks loose .
finn falls screaming to the floor . &#93;
Yo , man .
I think Marceline tricked us .
Jake : Yeah .
&#91; The ghosts &apos; mouths start to close in on our heroes when Marceline suddenly appears out of nowhere . &#93;
Marceline : VAMPIRE KICK ! ! !
&#91; She kicks the ghosts &apos; mouths away . &#93;
Finn .
Jake .
I &apos;m so sorry I got you into this .
I should &apos;ve never pranked you so perfectly .
Finn : It &apos;s okay .
You &apos;re here now to beat up those ghosts and save us .
Marceline : Oh , no , vampires can &apos;t beat ghosts .
It &apos;s sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing .
I just came to apologize .
Finn : Aw , man .
&#91; The ghosts &apos; mouths pick up Jake and Finn and start sucking on their heads . &#93;
I can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature .
&#91; Suddenly , the ghosts drop Finn . &#93;
Georgy : Uh ... did you guys say ... Heat Signature ?
&#91; The scene cuts to a clip from the movie Heat Signature .
A Commander and Private are inside a submarine , looking at a scanner . &#93;
Commander : Have you located the enemy &apos;s heat signature , Private ?
Private : Yes , sir .
But I also noticed something ... strange .
Something ...
I can &apos;t explain .
Commander : Well , spit it out , man !
Private : I ...
I ...
I can &apos;t seem to locate ... our heat signature .
&#91; The scene reverts back to Marceline &apos;s living room .
Marceline and the ghosts are watching in awe while Finn and Jake struggle about on the uncomfortable furniture , looking none too pleased . &#93;
Finn : &#91; groans in frustration &#93; This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop .
Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever ?
Georgy : MMM-HMM .
After the movie .
Finn : Well , can &apos;t we just-- Marceline and ghosts : Shhh !
Georgy : Shut !
Private : &#91; off screen &#93; Look out , Commander !
Commander : &#91; off screen &#93; Aaaagh !
My heat signature !
&#91; Marceline &apos;s face and the ghost &apos;s faces suddenly snap to a satisfied smile .
The episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins in an area filled with bones where Finn and Jake are playing . &#93;
Finn : Hahahaha !
Here I go !
Jake : Yeah !
Finn : &#91; Sliding down skeleton &#93; Whoo-hoo ! !
&#91; Finn hits the ground , and he , Jake , and many bones are propelled into the air .
Marceline watches them discreetly . &#93;
Marceline : Hmm ... &#91; Finn and Jake land . &#93;
Finn : Awesome !
&#91; He and Jake laugh .
Suddenly , crying is heard . &#93;
Someone needs our help !
&#91; Finn runs to the source of the crying .
Jake spits out a bone and follows .
They find Marceline talking to an old man . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; To her henchman &#93; What is it about &quot; henchman for life &quot; that you don &apos;t understand ?
Old Man Henchman : Oh , come on !
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; Dude !
It &apos;s Marceline the Vampire Queen !
&#91; Jake screams and cowers in fear . &#93;
Old Man Henchman : Can &apos;t you find the compassion to release this poor old body ?
Marceline : &quot; Henchman for life &quot; means , &quot; henchman for life ! ! &quot;
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; You still petrified of vampires ?
&#91; Jake &apos;s head has sunk into his body . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Prevaricating &#93; No ...
I &apos;m not ... Marceline : &#91; To old man &#93; Fall on the ground for me !
Old Man Henchman : Yes , Mistress .
&#91; He does so . &#93;
Marceline : Now cry for me !
Old Man Henchman : Okay .
I don &apos;t want to cry , but I shall cry for you .
&#91; He begins weeping . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Running from behind bushes &#93; Hey !
Cut that out !
Marceline : Oh !
If it isn &apos;t my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn !
Finn : Stop making this poor old dude cry !
Marceline : I can make him do whatever I want .
Watch .
Henchman , amuse me .
&#91; The old man balances himself on his cane . &#93;
Finn : Stop it !
Marceline : Now hop around in a circle .
&#91; The old man hops around on his cane .
The tip breaks and he falls down . &#93;
Finn : Oh , no .
Don &apos;t worry , sir .
I &apos;ll see to it you get set free .
Marceline : Oh , and how &apos;re ya gonna pull that off , hero ?
Finn : I &apos;ll do what I need to .
I &apos;ll even take his place !
Jake : Dude , what ? !
Marceline : Do you mean it ?
Finn : Uh ... well ... &#91; He looks at the old man who is groaning tiredly . &#93;
Heck yeah !
Marceline : Deal !
Old henchman , you &apos;re free .
Old Man Henchman : Whoo-hoo !
&#91; Leaps off happily &#93; Jake : What &apos;re you doing , man ?
Marceline : Hey , Jake ....
BLEH ! !
&#91; She makes a horrific face . &#93;
Jake : EEH !
&#91; Grabs onto Finn &#93; Finn : I couldn &apos;t watch that old man suffer , Jake .
My code of honor wouldn &apos;t allow it .
Marceline : &#91; Laughs &#93; &#91; Mocking Finn &#93; &quot; Oh , my code of honor wouldn &apos;t allow it . &quot;
&#91; Cackles &#93; Jake : Rrrr ... HEY !
Marceline : Yes , Jake ?
&#91; Transforms into a werewolf creature &#93; What would you like to talk about ? !
Jake : AAAH !
&#91; Runs to Finn &apos;s side &#93; I wanna help you outta this , man , but ... she scares the filling out of my doughnut .
Let &apos;s just leave .
Finn : I can &apos;t .
As a hero , I &apos;m bound by my &#91; Taken by Marceline into the air &#93; WOOOOORD ! !
Jake : FINN !
&#91; Marceline cackles as they fly into the air . &#93;
Don &apos;t worry , dude !
I &apos;ll figure something out ! !
&#91; Scene transition ; Marceline and Finn are flying through the air . &#93;
Marceline : You &apos;re lucky , Finn .
Your first job as henchman is to help me feed .
Finn : &#91; Gasps ; to himself &#93; Feed ? !
What does she mean ?
L-Like , like , oats ?
Like , sentient beings , or oats ? !
It doesn &apos;t matter !
I can handle it !
&#91; They arrive at a house that has music playing and a person singing . &#93;
Marceline : Sounds like dinner .
Finn , open the door .
&#91; Finn walks up to the door and strains himself . &#93;
OPEN IT ALREADY !
Finn : No way , Marceline !
I &apos;m not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt !
Marceline : Aren &apos;t you bound by your word to do as I say , hero ?
Finn : I ... &#91; Sighs &#93; Yes ... &#91; Turns and walks towards door &#93; &#91; Inside , the man is still playing .
The door is opened and the draft blows the candles out . &#93;
Eberhardt : Huh ?
Finn : Sorry about this .
Eberhardt : &#91; Scared &#93; Haah !
Marceline : Hold him down !
&#91; Finn groans .
Marceline and Finn enter and close the door behind them .
Jake appears and comes to the window . &#93;
Are you enjoying this , Finn ?
Finn : No !
&#91; Marceline laughs . &#93;
Jake : &#91; To himself &#93; Rrr ... Don &apos;t you worry , Finn .
I &apos;ll get you outta there .
I &apos;ve got a perfect plan !
&#91; Marceline laughs .
She notices Jake through the window and hisses at him , turning into a lizard creature . &#93;
AAH !
&#91; Running from window &#93; I &apos;m not running away , Finn !
This is just part of my plan ! !
Eberhardt : Please , human boy !
Let me go !
Finn : I &apos;m sorry , sir .
I &apos;m bound by my code of honor to do what she says .
Eberhardt : I understand , son .
I was married myself once .
&#91; A single tear drops from his right eye . &#93;
Finn : Wait , wait !
I &apos;m not married to — Marceline : &#91; Frustrated &#93; Ugh !
Enough talking !
Dinner is served !
Finn : No !
&#91; Pulls Eberhardt away before Marceline could bite him ; Marceline attacks again . &#93;
No !
&#91; Pulls him away again &#93; Marceline : How dare you , henchman ? !
I order you to let me feed !
&#91; Marceline blasts Finn &apos;s arms with a red beam , making them curl up and become immobile .
She laughs , hisses and bites Eberhardt .
Eberhardt screams . &#93;
Finn : NOOOOO ! ! !
&#91; Marceline is revealed to have only been sucking Eberhardt &apos;s crimson bow tie . &#93;
Marceline : Mmm .
That red bow tie was delicious !
Finn : &#91; Grunts &#93; Huh ?
&#91; Arms uncurl &#93; Marceline : What &apos;s wrong , Finn ?
Finn : I ...
I thought you were — Eberhardt : Oh , my !
A white tie !
Thank you so much !
This is so beautiful !
&#91; Passes out &#93; Finn : B-but ... Marceline : What ?
You know I eat the color red sometimes .
&#91; Winks &#93; Finn : Oh ... Yeah ...
Okay ... &#91; Scene transition ; they are flying through the air again . &#93;
Marceline : We &apos;ve got plenty more evil to do !
&#91; Laughs &#93; Finn : &#91; Thinking &#93; Man ... What &apos;s wrong with this girl ?
I can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s messin &apos; with me , or ... or what .
Marceline : Hey , Finn .
You thinkin &apos; about how that guy &apos;s bow tie sorta looked like a bra ?
Finn : Huh ?
No !
&#91; The two arrive at a graveyard . &#93;
Marceline : I know this place seems a little dead , but don &apos;t worry .
It &apos;ll soon be undead .
&#91; Finn whimpers . &#93;
Corpses buries in mud that &apos;s black , from death I command you to come back !
&#91; The dead bodies rise out of the ground .
( &quot; Eeehhh ... What &apos;s happening ?
Eh ... &quot; ) &#93; Hahaha !
Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead ? !
Finn : Uhh , NEVER !
&#91; A skeleton grabs Finn &apos;s rear end . &#93;
Okay !
I &apos;ll do it !
&#91; Marceline laughs .
Jake appears in the bushes . &#93;
Jake : &#91; To himself &#93; Don &apos;t worry , dude .
I &apos;m comin &apos; to help you .
YAAAAH ! !
&#91; Charges out of bushes with a stake towards Marceline &#93; Marceline : Huh ?
What &apos;s that noise ?
&#91; Marceline turns around .
As she does , Jake shrinks down and retreats . &#93;
Jake : &#91; To himself &#93; Sorry , Finn .
&#91; The scene shifts to the Duchy of Nuts where Finn and Marceline are walking towards the Duke of Nuts &apos; castle with an undead army following behind them . &#93;
Marceline : Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle ?
Finn : &#91; Faking &#93; Haha , aw , yeah , that sounds bombastic , honey !
Hey , I &apos;m gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you , sugar !
&#91; Runs hurriedly &#93; Marceline : Hahaha !
&#91; Finn knocks on the door .
Lisby answers . &#93;
Lisby : Yeeees ?
Duke and Duchess of Nuts &apos; residence !
Finn : My boss is gonna sack your castle !
Lisby : Oh !
Well , that &apos;s certainly bad news for us !
Duke of Nuts : Lisby !
Who &apos;s at the door ?
Lisby : Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle !
Duke of Nuts : Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son &apos;s first birthday ? !
SEIZE HIM !
Finn : No !
&#91; The army draws closer . &#93;
Listen !
You hear that ? !
My master is marching here with her army of the undead !
Duke of Nuts : Oh !
How wonderful !
Finn : Listen to me ! !
&#91; The army arrives . &#93;
EVERYBODY ! !
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES ! !
Marceline : Hahaha !
&#91; She flies into the palace . &#93;
I wrote this next song about a fisherman .
&#91; She sings the Fisherman Song . &#93;
Finn : Don &apos;t do this , Marceline !
I beg you !
Marceline : Don &apos;t do what ?
Duke of Nuts : You &apos;re late , Marceline !
My son has been dying to hear your undead music !
Finn : Wha ? !
Lisby : Oh , I forgot !
Marceline is playing tonight !
&#91; Marceline plays her bass .
Everyone starts partying . &#93;
Finn : Okay ...
So , she makes things seem bad , a-and then ... or-or her personality makes them seem bad , or ... &#91; Sighs &#93; I &apos;m over-reacting .
Lisby : Hey !
Finn : Huh ?
Lisby : Why are you thinking so hard ? !
Just party hard !
Whoo !
Finn : Alright !
Whoo-hoo !
Hahahaha !
Marceline : Hey , castle-crasher !
Finn : Hey , Marceline !
Marceline : You like cute things , right ?
Finn : Uh , yeah , sure .
Why ?
Marceline : Then you might love this .
The cutest dimple plant ever !
Finn : Whoa-ho-ho !
That &apos;s cool !
Marceline : Here , eat some of its fruit .
See what happens .
Finn : &#91; He does so .
Finn gains a dimple . &#93;
Hahaha !
A dimple !
Marceline : Okay , henchman , now ...
I need you to do something .
Finn : What is it ?
Marceline : I want you to take this dimple plant outside , and kill it !
Finn : What ? !
Marceline : &#91; Pulling it out &#93; Use my ax bass .
&#91; Scene shifts to outside where Finn is holding the guitar and standing in front of the plant . &#93;
Finn : I &apos;m gonna murder you .
I &apos;m not entirely sure why .
I &apos;m sure this will end happy ... &#91; Finn lifts up the ax and hesitates .
He throws down the guitar . &#93;
AAH !
I don &apos;t get it !
There &apos;s always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do , but where &apos;s the twist in bumping off this bush ? !
Marceline : &#91; Entering &#93; There is no twist .
Kill it now !
Finn : But wh — &#91; The plant turns into a monster . &#93;
Marceline : You should &apos;ve hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable ... Finn : I-I thought — &#91; The monster attacks Finn , but he evades the attack .
He rolls , jumps towards the dimple plant monster and cuts one of its limbs .
It sprays juice which Finn accidentally catches in his mouth .
It makes him gain dozens of dimples .
He spits the juice out . &#93;
Sick ! !
&#91; The monster grabs Finn and eats him . &#93;
Marceline : Oh , boy ... &#91; She simply detaches one of its limbs to kill the monster .
Finn axes himself free . &#93;
Not bad ... for a henchman .
Finn : &#91; Smiling &#93; Hmm ... &#91; The scene shifts to the next morning .
Finn and Marceline are in a strawberry patch . &#93;
Finn : Hey .
Can &apos;t the sun , like , destroy you ?
Marceline : Yeah , it hurts , but I kinda like it .
Reminds me of when I &apos;d scrape my knees up as a kid , and my mom would patch me up ... you know what I &apos;m sayin &apos; ?
Finn : Uh ... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage .
&#91; They both laugh . &#93;
Marceline : Hey , Finn , I need you to strangle some pixies .
Finn : Yeah , sure .
That sounds good .
Marceline : Whoa , why are you being so casual about that ?
Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil .
Finn : I &apos;m not fallin &apos; for your junk anymore , lady !
You just like sayin &apos; poop that jacks with my brain !
Marceline : &#91; Breaking &#93; What are you talking about ?
I ... &#91; Laughs &#93; Dang , man , I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d ever catch on !
Finn : &#91; Laughs &#93; I knew it !
Hey ... what about your old henchman ?
Who was that guy ?
Marceline : Oh , just an old diving buddy .
&#91; Jake emerges from the bushes . &#93;
&#91; Jokingly &#93; So , you ready to go strangle some pixies ?
Finn : Yeah , man !
I mean , wo-man .
Jake : &#91; To himself &#93; Oh , no !
My buddy is totally under her vampire spell !
&#91; Yelling out &#93; Die , unholy thing !
&#91; Throws garlic at her &#93; Finn : Jake ?
Marceline : &#91; The garlic hits her . &#93;
Ow !
&#91; She drops her umbrella and hisses loudly as she stares at the sun .
She moans as she falls on the ground and withers . &#93;
Finn : Marceline !
Jake : I &apos;m stakin &apos; that vampire and settin &apos; you free , no matter how terrified I am !
Finn : She &apos;s alright , man !
Jake : She &apos;s still controlling your mind with evil !
Now , back off and let me vanquish her from existence !
Finn : I can &apos;t let you do that , Jake !
Jake : &#91; Sighs deeply &#93; I love you , brother .
YAAAH !
&#91; Attacks Finn , forcing him to the ground &#93; Finn : Jake , listen !
Marceline is not how she seems !
She &apos;s a radical dame who likes to play games !
Jake : What are you even talkin &apos; about , dude ? !
&#91; Marceline crawls under the umbrella . &#93;
Finn : Oh , man !
&#91; Kicks Jake off his person &#93; &#91; As Finn runs towards the umbrella , Jake smacks him away . &#93;
Jake : MARCELINE !
&#91; Jake stakes the umbrella .
As he lifts it , there &apos;s nothing but smoke and wailing is heard . &#93;
Where is she ? !
Finn : &#91; Faking &#93; I-I &apos;m free !
Jake !
You faced your fear and saved me !
Jake : I did ? !
I did !
Yeah !
&#91; singing &#93; I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire ! !
&#91; Runs away and laughs triumphantly . &#93;
&#91; Finn holds up the umbrella .
Marceline ( as a bat ) comes out of Finn &apos;s pack . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Whispering &#93; Is it cool ?
Finn : Yup !
Marceline : Finn , I owe you big-time !
Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius !
Finn : That &apos;s what henchmen are for .
Marceline : Oh , uh , that reminds me .
You &apos;re fired from your henchman-ship .
It &apos;s no fun when I can &apos;t trick you .
Finn : We &apos;re still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow , though , right ?
Marceline : &#91; Flying away with the umbrella &#93; Definitely .
Jake : You want some more eggs , BMO ?
BMO : Yes , please .
Jake : &#91; Gives BMO more eggs &#93; How &apos; bout you , Finny ?
Need a refill ?
Finn : I &apos;m pretty full , man ... but lemme see if I can ... rearrange .
&#91; Tries to move food in his stomach but fails &#93; Nope .
Can &apos;t do it .
Jake : I don &apos;t know if stomachs work like that , dude .
Finn : Sometimes it helps .
Jake : Can &apos;t argue with that !
&#91; Relaxes &#93; Ahh ... Finn : &#91; Relaxing &#93; Ahh ... BMO : &#91; Moving arms up &#93; Ahh ... &#91; Telephone rings and Jake groans . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Answering &#93; Hello ?
Lady , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
Mm-hmm .
Alright , I love you , too .
Bye .
&#91; Hangs up &#93; Finn : Lady Rainicorn again ?
Jake : Yeah , man .
She &apos;s worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today .
She thinks they &apos;re gonna freak out .
Finn : Um ... maybe give her parents some treasure ?
Jake : No way !
That &apos;s our treasure !
Wait .
I &apos;ve got it , dude !
I &apos;ll invite them over early , smooth them over using my personality , and we &apos;ll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn &apos;t have to feel nervous !
It &apos;s perfect !
I &apos;ll just send them a quick Prism-gram .
&#91; Begins writing &#93; Mm-hmm .
&#91; He finishes and sends the message .
The reply comes within seconds . &#93;
Finn : What &apos;s it say ?
Jake : Hold on .
It &apos;s still converting the light waves into brain waves .
&#91; The crystal shoots a beam into his head . &#93;
Ahh ...
They &apos;re into it , dude !
Finn : Sweet !
Let &apos;s go powder our noses !
&#91; Scene shifts to Finn and Jake &apos;s bedroom . &#93;
Finn : Why &apos;s Lady so nervous , anyway ?
Jake : Well ... she didn &apos;t really say , but it might have somethin &apos; to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars .
Finn : There were wars between rainicorns and dogs ?
Jake : Horrifying wars .
For thousands of years , rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension ... but Lady and I are cool .
Finn : Dude !
Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times !
They &apos;re gonna see you &apos;re a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again !
Jake : ... Nah .
That could never happen .
Finn : You didn &apos;t think this through enough ...
IT COULD HAPPEN ! !
Jake : AAAH !
I &apos;M A MORON !
Finn : Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ve got a plan that &apos;s gonna solve this biz .
Homies help homies .
Always .
Jake : I &apos;m ready to hear your plan , homie .
&#91; Finn whispers to Jake ; in the next scene they can be seen painting the treasure room and singing The Decorating Song , while Jake morphs himself into a rainicorn . &#93;
Finn : Haha , yeah !
This plan is perfect !
Jake : You know , I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago , but now I &apos;m not so sure , man .
Finn : Come ooonnn .
Trust me , homie .
Jake : &#91; Worried &#93; No , no , no , new plan .
First , we &apos;re gonna clean this place up , and then — &#91; Doorbell rings &#93; Huh ? !
Ethel : Jake ?
Jake : AAAAH ... &#91; To Finn &#93; LET &apos;S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN !
&#91; Bob rings the doorbell two more times , then he and his wife look at each other . &#93;
Bob : &#91; Knocking &#93; Hello ?
&#91; they have universal translators &#93; Jake : 안 녕 하 세 요 .
( &quot; Hello . &quot; )
Ethel : Jake , is that you ?
Jake : Uh-huh .
Ethel : Are you going to let us in ?
Jake : Y-yeeeaaah ... &#91; Opens door &#93; Ethel : AAAAAAHHHH ! ! !
Jake : I can explain ! !
I can explain ! !
Ethel : OOOHHHHH , he &apos;s so handsome !
Oh , Bob , our daughter &apos;s finally found a handsome rainicorn to love !
Jake : You think I &apos;m a rainicorn ?
Bob : I think we can spot a member of our own species , Jake .
We &apos;re not blind .
Ethel : Well , we are a little blind .
Bob : Yes , I guess we are a little blind .
Jake : Uh , well , hey !
Come on in !
It &apos;s awesome to finally meet you both !
Ethel : Your house is very colorful .
I like that !
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; Haha !
The plan is working , homie !
Bob : Jake , what is that thing that &apos;s talking ?
Jake : Uh ... that &apos;s um ... Finn : I &apos;m Jake &apos;s rainicorn roommate !
Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance !
&#91; Starts chanting and dancing &#93; Bob : Jake , please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage !
Jake : Uh ... y-yes !
&#91; To Finn &#93; Get outta here , goblin !
Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks !
Finn : But — Jake : &#91; Whispering &#93; Come on , homie , help me !
Finn : &#91; Smiles &#93; &#91; Whispering &#93; Ha !
You got it , homie !
Jake : Uh ... please , c-come upstairs .
&#91; Scene shifts to the living room . &#93;
Jake : My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment .
Bob : Thank you , Jake .
I &apos;m glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension .
Ethel : Yes , we &apos;re eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that &apos;s dating our daughter .
Bob : Ethel ... Jake : Well , ask me whatever you like , Ethel , Bob !
Ethel : I am a little curious about your goblin .
He looks a little odd .
Jake : Well ... he &apos;s actually a human .
Ethel : Oh , Bob !
Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler !
Bob : Shh .
&#91; To Jake &#93; Thank you , Jake , for being interested in our daughter !
Jake : Uh ... No problem , Bob !
Ethel : Oh !
Let &apos;s play some traditional rainicorn games !
Bob : Jake , do you know Cameladabalawabapp ?
&#91; Note : the name is pronounced with blowing a small raspberry at the end . &#93;
Jake : Uh , s-say it again ?
Bob : Cameladabalawabapp !
Jake : Ohhhh !
&#91; Laughs &#93; Cablatapuamba — &#91; Blows raspberry &#93; !
I thought you said &quot; Kabloderaga — &#91; Blows raspberry &#93; &quot; !
&#91; Chuckles &#93; Ah , man , I love gettin &apos; down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba — &#91; Blows raspberry &#93; !
Ha !
Y &apos;all should go first , though .
Bob : Hmm .
Bold move letting your opponent move first , Jake .
I respect that .
Very well .
Cameladabalawabapp ! !
&#91; Fires a beam from his horn at the wall , which turns red . &#93;
Ethel : Oh , Bob !
Bob : Haha !
Your turn , Jake !
Jake : I ... Finn : &#91; Entering &#93; Snacks !
Get your snacks !
Jake : &#91; To himself &#93; Finn !
&#91; Whispering to him &#93; Dude !
I have to show Lady &apos;s parents that I have rainbow powers !
I need homie help !
Finn : Hmm ...
I got a plan , bro-ham .
Just stretch your horn at me , and I &apos;ll take care of the rest .
Jake : You &apos;re the best , homie .
Finn : Homies help homies .
Jake : Haha !
&#91; He steps back and Finn breathes in and holds his breath , then gives a thumbs-up . &#93;
Cablatapuamba — &#91; Blows raspberry &#93; !
&#91; Jake stretches his &quot; horn &quot; at Finn .
Finn &apos;s face begins to turn red from holding his breath .
Finn falls over and releases his breath .
Ethel and Bob applaud Jake . &#93;
Ethel : Very unusual color palette , Jake .
Bob : Yes .
Subtle .
Jake : Whoo !
Oh , yeah !
&#91; Finn is breathing heavily on the floor . &#93;
Finn ?
Bob : How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games , my boy ?
Jake : I , uh ... Oh .
Um ... let &apos;s do it !
Bob and Ethel : Let the games begin !
&#91; Musical montage begins .
Bob and Ethel begin flying .
Jake &quot; flies &quot; by having Finn carry him . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Whispering to Finn &#93; I &apos;m sorry .
&#91; Finn scowls .
Next , Ethel , Bob , and Jake wrestle with their horns .
Ethel charges into Finn from behind and knocks him down ; she and Bob laugh .
Finn looks at Jake who just shrugs helplessly .
Next , Finn is places on a coiled-up Ethel , who suddenly juts out like a spring , sending Finn flying off into a glass bottle .
Bob places Finn on a coiled-up Jake who does the same , reluctantly .
Finn falls through the ceiling of the living room in the Tree Fort . &#93;
Jake : &#91; To the parents &#93; Yo , my bad !
I &apos;ll get &apos; im !
&#91; Jake enters the fort panting . &#93;
Hey , man .
How &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
Finn : &#91; Angry &#93; IT &apos;S &quot; GOING &quot; CRUD-COW !
Jake : I know , I know , I &apos;m sorry .
But they really like me .
Your plan is working perfectly !
Finn : Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan !
Not in the plan !
Jake : Look , Finn , you know I got yo back fo &apos; -eva &apos; , but right now , you &apos;re the only one who can help me .
Come on , homie .
&#91; He smiles at Finn who is still making an angry face . &#93;
Homies help homies .
&#91; Finn smiles . &#93;
&#91; Ethel and Bob enter laughing . &#93;
Hey , guys .
You ready to get this game goin &apos; again ?
Ethel : Oh , no , we &apos;re pooped .
Bob : Yeah , we &apos;re about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in !
Jake : Wohhh , no .
You &apos;re my guests .
Let me take care of you .
&#91; Whispering to Finn &#93; Homie ... help me cook something , please .
Finn : ... Okay .
Jake : Thanks , Finn .
&#91; To Ethel and Bob &#93; Okay .
Don &apos;t worry about a thing .
Finn &apos;ll make a great lunch .
He &apos;s a little raw , but he &apos;s got great taste .
Bob : What ? !
Wow !
So wealthy , and so generous !
Ethel : Ah !
I was hoping !
&#91; Laughs &#93; I was afraid to ask !
&#91; Ethel and Bob gather around Finn .
Bob rips off Finn &apos;s shirt . &#93;
Finn : WAAAH !
Jake ! !
I think they wanna eat me ! !
Ethel : Of course we do !
Jake said you &apos;d &quot; make a great lunch &quot; !
Finn : JAKE !
COME ON !
Jake : &#91; Panicking &#93; Man , oh , man , oh , man , oh , man .... &#91; Bob bites Finn &apos;s stomach . &#93;
Finn : AAAH !
Knock it off , Bob ! !
&#91; Punches him &#93; Ethel : &#91; Punching Finn &#93; Don &apos;t you touch him ! !
&#91; The three continue fighting . &#93;
Jake : Come on , stop it , guys !
Come on , y &apos;all , I said stop !
&#91; Growls angrily then grows huge &#93; NOW , THAT &apos;S ENOUGH ! ! !
Nobody &apos;s eating Finn ! !
He &apos;s not my butler , and he &apos;s not food !
Finn is my friend !
&#91; Ethel and Bob gasp . &#93;
I &apos;m sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand .
I just got so scared of losing Lady !
&#91; To himself &#93; But if they hate me , so be it .
No more lies .
&#91; Retracts to his default form &#93; Ethel : &#91; Gasps &#93; You &apos;re a dog ?
Jake : Yeah , I just ... &#91; Groans &#93; Look , I &apos;m sorry about everything .
I was — Bob : YAAAAAY !
HA-HEEEY !
HURRAAAAY !
&#91; Ethel and Bob celebrate by singing &quot; The Lucky Ones , &quot; dancing , and hugging Jake . &#93;
Jake : Uh ... uh ... &#91; Gasps &#93; Lady ? !
Lady Rainicorn : 어 , 나 도 우 리 부 모 님 때 문 에 걱 정 했 었 어 !
우 리 엄 마 아 빠 는 개 라 면 완 전 맛 이 가 거 든 !
개 가 전 쟁 터 에 서 우 리 아 빠 생 명 을 구 해 줬 었 어 !
( &quot; Oh , I was worried about my parents !
My mom and dad are crazy about dogs !
A dog saved my dad in the war ! &quot; )
Finn : What did she say ?
Jake : She said she worried that they &apos;d freak out ... &apos; cause her parents are bananas for dogs !
Finn : J.J. FLIP !
What the zip ? !
&#91; Lady hands Finn a photo . &#93;
Jake : Yeah !
She says a dog saved her dad in the war !
Finn : Wow !
That &apos;s flippin &apos; awesome .
&#91; Scene shifts to outside the fort .
Everyone is having a picnic . &#93;
Ethel : Finn .
Finn : &#91; Stops staring at his food &#93; ... Wha ?
Ethel : Listen , I just want you to know how sorry we are about ... trying to eat you .
Bob : It &apos;s just we thought we &apos;d never get another chance .
We thought humans were extinct .
Finn : Oh .
Jake : So ... this isn &apos;t human ?
Ethel : Oh , no .
This is soy people !
Finn : Oh .
Ethel : I &apos;ve never tasted real human before , but they say you can &apos;t even tell the difference !
&#91; Finn touches his food , which begins to secrete a strange liquid . &#93;
Jake : Ew ... Soy ?
&#91; Eats some and smiles &#93; FINN , YOU &apos;RE DELICIOUS !
&#91; Finn disconcertedly watches the rest of the group eat .
He stares at his food and cautiously puts some of it in his mouth .
He smiles and the episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode begins with Finn , Jake , and the Swamp Giant falling from a great height .
They are both gripping onto the giant . &#93;
Swamp Giant : AAAAH !
Finn : Last chance , Swamp Giant !
Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen !
Swamp Giant : NEVER ! !
&#91; The three scream as they fall .
Squeaking is heard . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
&#91; He finds the Mini Queen . &#93;
Hi , Mini Queen !
Jake !
I &apos;ve got &apos; er !
Jake : Then hold my hand , dude !
&#91; Finn does so . &#93;
Whoooop !
&#91; Jake inflates , making himself and Finn reach terminal velocity sooner and float gently to the ground . &#93;
Swamp Giant : Aaaah !
Oof !
&#91; The swamp giant hits the ground .
Finn and Jake land on the flattened giant .
Jake lets his air out and deflates . &#93;
Finn : My inflatable angel .
Jake : Heh heh heh .
&#91; They jump off the giant . &#93;
How &apos;s the Mini Queen ?
Finn : I dunno .
Can &apos;t understand a word she says .
&#91; The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on Finn &apos;s hand that says , &quot; THANK YOU 4 SAVING ME , XOXO CALL ME . &quot;
The Mini Queen shapes her antennae to look like a heart . &#93;
Aww !
My pleasure , ma &apos;am !
I just like beating up evil !
&#91; Finn performs a &quot; handshake &quot; with one of her antennae .
She squeaks . &#93;
Okay ...
Didn &apos;t ... catch any of that either .
&#91; The Mini Queen jumps on Jake &apos;s nose and then leaps away . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Sniffs &#93; Mini Queen must &apos;ve stepped in somethin &apos; funky .
&#91; Sniffs &#93; No ...
It &apos;s not tiny feet I &apos;m smelling !
This way !
&#91; He sniffs the ground and follows a scent .
The scent leads him to a sword . &#93;
Whoa !
Finn : What ?
Jake : &#91; In awe &#93; Do you know whose sword this is ? !
This is the sword of Billy !
Finn : Billy ? !
Finn and Jake : &#91; Singing &#93; BIIILLYYYYYY ! ! !
&#91; Flashback &#93; Young Billy : Nothung !
&#91; The sword comes to Billy and sparks lightning dramatically .
The musical sequence begins . &#93;
&#91; Back in the present &#93; Finn : Oh , yeah !
That was the most mathematical thing ever !
Jake : Oh , yeah !
Hahaha !
He fought a bear !
Finn : This is so cool !
&#91; He attempts to pull out the sword .
The ground cracks and makes a hole in the side of the mountain appear . &#93;
Finn and Jake : Whoa !
Finn : It &apos;s Billy &apos;s legendary crack !
&#91; They go inside .
They gasp as they are treated with Billy &apos;s presence . &#93;
Billy : &#91; Sighs &#93; Hello .
Finn : &#91; Whispering to Jake &#93; It &apos;s him !
It &apos;s him ! !
Jake : &#91; Whispering &#93; I know , I know !
Be cool ! !
Billy : Yep .
It &apos;s me .
Finn : Man !
I &apos;m such a huge nerd for you !
Please take us on as hero apprentices !
Billy : What for ?
Finn : So that we could learn to kick evil &apos;s butt ... just like you !
Jake : I wanna be the dog version of you !
Billy : Ahh , that &apos;d be a waste of time .
Jake : Heh .
Yeah .
I-I &apos;m a little paunchy ... but I could do some sit-ups !
Billy : No , I was talking about beating up monsters .
It &apos;s as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail .
Jake : Heh .
See , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong ... &apos; cuz watch !
&#91; He tries to catch his tail , of course to no avail . &#93;
Ah ... ah ... Finn : What do you mean , &quot; pointless ? &quot;
We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster !
Billy : You know where she is right now ?
She &apos;s probably being eaten by a different monster .
She &apos;s probably dead .
&#91; Finn gasps . &#93;
In my youth , I was much like you .
Motivated .
Headstrong .
Wore a silly , little outfit .
Even had a magic dog .
&#91; Billy points to his skeleton of a dog . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Scared , yet smiling &#93; Heh ...
I &apos;m gonna pass out ... &#91; Falls backward &#93; Billy : All my life , I &apos;ve beaten on evil creatures .
&#91; Deep sigh &#93; But new evil keeps popping up .
Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort !
Jake : What other way is there ?
Billy : Nonviolently .
Help people by being active in your community .
Finn : Nonviolently ? ?
&#91; Sighs &#93; I gotta try being nonviolent ... the Billy way ... Jake : Me , too !
Finn : Billy , I won &apos;t let you down !
Jake : I love you , Billy !
I got a secret crush on you , Billy !
&#91; They run away screaming .
Billy sighs wearily .
The scene shifts to the Grass Lands .
Finn is riding on Jake . &#93;
Finn : This is gonna be tough , Jake .
I &apos;ll have to suppress my every warrior instinct .
Jake : Relax .
It &apos;ll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people .
Cobbler : Help !
Help !
&#91; Finn and Jake notice his cries . &#93;
A monster !
&#91; The cobbler runs into Jake &apos;s leg .
Jake retracts . &#93;
Oh !
Thank goodness !
Heroes !
I &apos;m being chased by a horrible Dragon !
Please , please help !
Finn : Oh , uh ... Jake : Oh ... Cobbler : Act quickly !
He &apos;s almost upon us !
Jake : &#91; Straightforward &#93; Sorry .
We don &apos;t beat stuff up anymore .
Cobbler : No , but please !
&#91; Stammers frantically &#93; Finn : &#91; To Jake &#93; Dude .
We gotta do something to help him .
Jake : I could teach &apos; im how to not be such a spaz .
Finn : &#91; To cobbler &#93; Hey , Mister .
Besides being chased by a monster , what else is wrong ?
Cobbler : Well ...
I &apos;ve been running all day .
I guess I &apos;m pretty hungry .
Jake : Say no more .
&#91; Walking away , pulling Finn with him &#93; Come on , Finn .
Cobbler : Where &apos;re you going ? !
Jake : To make you somethin &apos; to eat !
&#91; They leave .
The dragon arrives . &#93;
Cobbler : AAAH ! !
NO ! !
HELP ! !
&#91; The dragon attacks him by breathing fire .
The scene transitions to a town where Finn and Jake are running a food stand . &#93;
Finn : I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon .
Jake : Trust me .
This is a way better way to help &apos; im .
&#91; Yelling out &#93; Gruel !
Get your free gruel !
Lady : &#91; Walking up to stand &#93; What &apos;s this all about ?
Finn : Free gruel , ma &apos;am .
I can &apos;t beat monster butts , but I can beat your hungry guts .
That &apos;s for sure !
Lady : Hahaha !
&#91; Eats gruel &#93; I didn &apos;t throw up !
This gruel is very adequate .
Finn : &#91; Victoriously &#93; YEAH ! ! !
&#91; Cut to the other townspeople eating Finn and Jake &apos;s gruel . &#93;
Finn : This is great , Jake !
Jake : Yeah , we &apos;re really helpin &apos; people !
Finn : Whoa !
Look who it is !
&#91; The cobbler walks up to Finn and Jake .
There are scorch marks on him . &#93;
Jake : Dude !
You &apos;re alive !
Cobbler : &#91; Angrily &#93; No thanks to you two ! !
That dragon chased me for two days ! !
... And then I was lost for ... uh , three days ... and then I ...
I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for ... &#91; Unsure &#93; a week ?
So that &apos;s two , plus three , plus a week — &#91; Jake shushes him . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Deliberate &#93; Dude .
Gruel .
Cobbler : Oh , thank you !
&#91; Eats it &#93; Hahahaha !
Hahaha .
&#91; His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone . &#93;
AAAH !
WHAT &apos;S HAPPENING ? !
Finn : Huh ?
&#91; Holds up glass with potion in it &#93; Oh , that &apos;s probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe .
It gives your body the power to grow armor .
Cobbler : Wha ?
Ah ...
uh ? !
&#91; More of his body becomes encased in stone .
The cobbler strikes himself with a fork , and it has no effect .
The cobbler panics . &#93;
Jake : Dude ... how much of that potion did you use ?
&#91; Finn holds up five more empty potion bottles .
The townspeople have grown armor as well .
One of the townspeople &apos;s belly button starts shooting flames . &#93;
Townsperson : AAAAH ! !
MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE ! ! !
Finn : &#91; To Jake &#93; Geez ...
I thought people would like that .
Cobbler : Why ? !
Why would anyone want that ? !
Finn : So you can defend against evil monsters !
Cobbler : You &apos;re supposed to beat up monsters so we don &apos;t have to defend ourselves !
Finn : No , see ?
I &apos;m helping you nonviolently !
Cobbler : Helping ? !
I can &apos;t even move my hands !
I &apos;m a cobbler !
How &apos;m I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts ? !
Finn : Sooo ... the village needs the help of a new cobbler , eh ?
Finn and Jake : &#91; Thinking &#93; Hmmmmmm ... Cobbler : WHAT ? !
NO — &#91; Cut to the shoe-repair shop . &#93;
Finn : Alright !
We &apos;re cobblers !
Cobbler : No , you &apos;re not ! !
You &apos;re just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist !
&#91; Leaving &#93; And don &apos;t try to cobble anything !
Jake : &#91; To Finn &#93; What does &quot; cobble &quot; mean , anyway ?
Finn : I think it has something to do with shoes ... Fine Lady : &#91; Entering shop &#93; Excuse me !
Can you help me ?
I need a broken heel fixed .
I &apos;m going to a fancy funeral .
Finn : &#91; Taking shoe and heel &#93; Of course I &apos;ll help !
&#91; Scene transition .
Finn is hammering in the heel . &#93;
Finn : There !
&#91; Rolling over to lady &#93; Whah !
&#91; He puts the shoe on her foot . &#93;
Pa-kow ! !
Fine Lady : Ah !
&#91; She seems content with the repair .
Suddenly , a blade comes out of the shoe .
The lady makes a small gasp . &#93;
Finn : Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral !
Jake : &#91; To Finn &#93; Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail ?
Finn : Maybe ... &#91; The shoe arms axes , an extra blade , and a lasso . &#93;
Whoa !
Jake : Cool !
Fine Lady : I cannot go to the funeral in these !
Cobbler : &#91; Entering shop &#93; Hey , everyone !
I &apos;m back from the doctor !
&#91; The lady &apos;s shoe lace lasso &apos;s the cobbler . &#93;
WHY ? !
&#91; The lace forces the cobbler to the ground . &#93;
Fine Lady : &#91; To Finn and Jake &#93; ... And I &apos;m not supposed to bring a guest .
Cobbler : &#91; To Finn and Jake &#93; GET OUT ! !
&#91; Cut to outside the shop . &#93;
Finn : Apparently , I suck at being nonviolent .
Jake : Dude , suckin &apos; at somethin &apos; is the first step towards bein &apos; sorta good at somethin &apos; .
You and I are like little baby Billys right now , and we &apos;re &quot; sucking &quot; on our first bottle of nonviolent milk !
Finn : &#91; Frustrated sigh &#93; Totes .
I &apos;ll stop &quot; pooping &quot; my diaper .
Jake : Whoa , what ? !
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button : HELP !
I NEED MEDICAL HELP ! !
Finn : Medical help ?
Hmmmmm ... &#91; The scene shifts to the hospital where Finn and Jake are doctors . &#93;
Finn : How can we help ?
Lumpy Space Princess : I want surgery to make my body hot .
Finn : Yikes ... Lumpy Space Princess : Yeah .
I know I &apos;m already pretty smokin &apos; ... but I bought this swimsuit , so I need a swimsuit body .
Jake : &#91; Whistles &#93; &#91; To Finn &#93; You up for some serious plastic surgery ?
&#91; The Adventure Time logo swirls onto the screen . &#93;
&#91; Lumpy Space Princess comes out of the hospital with a new body , complete with legs . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Aw , yeah !
This body &apos;s hot !
And powerful !
&#91; Suddenly , machine parts form on her body like a cyborg . &#93;
Huh ? !
Aw , what ? !
&#91; Her legs turns into a wheel .
She makes pained noises . &#93;
Jake : Dude , did you use a magic nail again ?
Finn : I &apos;ve got three left !
Lumpy Space Princess : Ohhhh ... &#91; She gains a robotic eye . &#93;
What did you do to me ? ?
Finn : We transformed you into a cyborg fighter !
That &apos;s hot , right ?
Lumpy Space Princess : No one thinks this look is hot ! !
&#91; The cobbler suddenly walks up . &#93;
Cobbler : &#91; To Lumpy Space Princess &#93; Oh , my laces !
You &apos;re the most beautiful — &#91; He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Huh ? !
&#91; Her wheel activates , and she speeds into the cobbler .
The townsperson with the flame-shooting belly button runs by again screaming . &#93;
Finn : ... Jake ... ?
Jake : .... Yeah ... ?
Finn : I think us being nonviolent ... is hurting people .
Man ... Billy is gonna be so bummed out ... Jake : Not if we run away , Finn !
We &apos;ll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals !
We &apos;ll survive !
Finn : I just wanna sit here and moan .
Jake : Then I &apos;ll moan with ya , buddy .
Finn : &#91; Moaning &#93; Thaaaanks , buuuddy ... Jake : &#91; Moaning &#93; Yoooouuu &apos;rrre weeeelcooome ... &#91; Finn and Jake notice more cries for help . &#93;
Old Lady : AAAH !
AAAH !
HELP ME ! !
Swamp Giant : Hahaha !
Relax !
I &apos;m just gonna grind you up ! !
Old Lady : AAAH !
AAAH !
Jake : &#91; To Finn &#93; Aw , man , this grass-bag again ? ?
&#91; Heroically &#93; HEY , EVIL-DOER !
&#91; Weakly &#93; Um ... could you keep your evil-doing quiet ?
Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here .
Swamp Giant : It &apos;s not evil ! !
When they get this old , they wanna be ground up ! !
Hahaha !
Right , you old bat ? !
Old Lady : Help ! !
&#91; Finn sweats . &#93;
Swamp Giant : Right ? ! ?
&#91; Finn strains , visibly in conflict . &#93;
Old Lady : Oooh ! !
Aaah ! !
&#91; Finn raises his fist . &#93;
Finn : Huh ? ?
A fist raised in righteous anger ? !
Oh , no !
It &apos;s my fist ! !
I &apos;ve gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin &apos; this guy in the face ! !
Hmmm ...
Swamp Giant : &#91; To Old Lady &#93; Yeah , you wanna get ground up , right ? ! ?
Finn : &#91; Furiously &#93; WRONG ! ! ! !
&#91; He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant , saving the Old Lady . &#93;
&#91; Quietly , to Jake &#93; I couldn &apos;t think of anything ... Old Lady : Whooo !
&#91; Falls in Finn &apos;s and Jake &apos;s arms &#93; Finn : POOP ! !
I saved her with violence ... Old Lady : What &apos;s your huff , son ?
Finn : The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent ... and I promised I would do that and not let him down ... but I did let &apos; im down .
Old Lady : Stuff and nonsense !
You sure helped this old gal out !
And you did it with violence !
Like a true hero , you were born to punch evil creatures !
&#91; Punches Finn &#93; Just like I was born to be an old lady !
Don &apos;t deny your rowdy nature , paladins !
&#91; Starts dancing &#93; And don &apos;t take advice from old people !
&#91; Continues dancing &#93; Finn : Yeah ... Yeah ... !
YEAH ! !
That old lady has a point !
Jake : Wait , didn &apos;t she say not to take advice from old peo — Finn : It &apos;s all so clear to me !
Back to the cave of Billy ! !
Jake : Cha ! !
&#91; Scene transition to Billy &apos;s cave . &#93;
Finn : It &apos;s us again .
Jake : And we &apos;ve got exciting news !
Billy : Aw , I don &apos;t — I don &apos;t wanna buy anything .
Finn : Billy , an old lady told me that I shouldn &apos;t listen to you because you &apos;re old .
Also , that I should do what I was born to do ... which is kickin &apos; buns .
Billy : Don &apos;t you see how pointless it is ?
You know what &apos;s probably happening to that old lady right now ?
She &apos;s probably dead !
Jake : She &apos;s right here .
&#91; Turns around , revealing her &#93; Old Lady : Hello !
&#91; Billy gasps . &#93;
Finn : We saved &apos; er , Billy .
Jake : You saved &apos; er .
Finn : I saved &apos; er , Billy .
I saved &apos; er using violence .
And that &apos;s not a bad thing , Billy !
This old lady is alive because of these !
&#91; Holds up fists and leg &#93; And look how happy she is , man !
She &apos;s elated !
Billy : Hmm .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
&#91; Pained groan &#93; It &apos;s ... it &apos;s as if your words are filling a void in my very being ... You wanna watch ?
&#91; He reveals a literal void in his stomach .
Finn and Jake gasp .
The hole starts filling up with body mass . &#93;
Nothung !
&#91; The sword comes back once again . &#93;
Finn and Jake ... truly , you are my heroes .
&#91; They laugh excitedly . &#93;
Now you &apos;re freakin &apos; me out ... &#91; Finn , Jake , and the old lady climb on Billy enthusiastically .
Finn and Jake are taken off . &#93;
Jake : We &apos;re his heroes ! !
&#91; Billy looks at the old lady . &#93;
Billy : Huh ... Hello .
Jake : Ha !
Haha !
I love you , Billy ! !
Billy : Get outta here ! !
&#91; Finn and Jake run out quickly , laughing heartily .
As Finn and Jake happily wander off , Billy nods contentedly .
The episode comes to a close . &#93;
&#91; Episode starts in the Breakfast Kingdom .
Breakfast Princess is eating breakfast alongside Toast Princess in a bed .
Ice King peers at them through a window .
He starts laughing . &#93;
Ice King : Good morning , Breakfast Princesses .
&#91; He sneakily climbs in through the window .
He comes up beside their bed with a jar of honey and a honey dipper .
He drips honey on Breakfast Princess &apos;s waffles . &#93;
Breakfast Princess : Huh ?
&#91; Ice King looks up at them , mumbling incoherently and then suddenly frowns . &#93;
Sis , give me the phone .
&#91; Toast Princess hands her a phone from beside their bed .
Breakfast Princess dials a number . &#93;
&#91; talking on phone : &#93; Oh , hey , Finn .
I got another Ice King situation here .
Oh , yeah ?
That would be great !
Thanks .
&#91; Finn and Jake barge through a door in the room . &#93;
Finn : Ice King ? !
How many times have we warned you about using love potion ?
Ice King : That &apos;s why I &apos;m using honey .
Jake : Man , who cares if it &apos;s honey ?
You stink anyways .
Finn : &#91; laughs &#93; Yeah , you stink so much I &apos;m gonna ground you for a week !
Ice King : What ?
You can &apos;t do that !
Finn : You &apos;re grounded for two weeks !
Ice King : You &apos;re grounded for two weeks !
Finn : &#91; slowly &#93; Three weeks .
Jake : Oh , snaps !
Ice King : Why ?
I didn &apos;t do anything .
Finn : Four weeks ?
Ice King : &#91; Ice King slaps his face and drags his hands down to his beard while facing the ceiling .
He suddenly looks at Finn . &#93;
Fine .
But I &apos;m only gonna do it for a week .
Finn : That just grounded you for four weeks .
Jake : Oh , dang !
Ice King : &#91; sighs &#93; Okay .
&#91; Ice King starts to walk out .
He turns back to look at Finn and Jake .
Jake gives him the peace sign on both hands while Finn just smiles at him . &#93;
What &apos;s up with the peace sign ?
Jake : Oh , nah , I &apos;m just trying to show you how many weeks ya got .
Finn : Get outta here , bubble-butt !
&#91; Ice King runs out while screaming .
His butt outline is shown through his clothes .
Finn and Jake laugh when he &apos;s gone . &#93;
Jake : Awesome .
&#91; Finn and Jake knuckle-punch . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to the Ice Kingdom at night .
Ice King is heard screaming .
The scene changes to inside Ice King &apos;s home . &#93;
Ice King : This is so unfair !
They &apos;re the ones who should be grounded .
Not me !
&#91; Ice King shakes his head quickly . &#93;
I &apos;m so mad !
I could just hit them !
If only I could hit them without leaving the castle .
&#91; Ice King taps his crown while closing his eyes in concentration .
He gets an idea and goes over to his computer .
He starts typing . &#93;
&#91; reading what he &apos;s typing : &#93; H ... I ... T ... M ... A ... N.
&#91; in his own thoughts : &#93; Ooh !
&#91; A profile pops up .
It is the Scorcher &apos;s profile .
It reads : SCORCHER Hitman - Hits people for you .
QUICK .
QUIET .
RELENTLESS .
contact &#93; Ice King : Perfect .
&#91; reading what he &apos;s typing &#93; Dear Mr. Scorcher , I would like you to hit two people .
Neat name by the way .
Love , the Ice King .
&#91; Ice King types out &lt; 3 to signify a heart when he says love . &#93;
&#91; The Scorcher appears behind Ice King right after he sent the email .
Ice King screams in surprise . &#93;
Ice King : Whoa , you are fast .
&#91; The Scorcher looks at him and says nothing . &#93;
And quiet .
&#91; The Scorcher continues to look at him quietly . &#93;
And very good at dramatic silence .
I like it .
&#91; Ice King gets up from his chair by the computer . &#93;
Alright , so , how do we do this ?
We shake hands or ... &#91; The Scorcher &apos;s hand lights on fire and Ice King screams in fright .
The Scorcher produces a contract from the fires .
He hands it to Ice King . &#93;
Oh-ho , paperwork !
&#91; The contract reads : Who shall I hit ? &#93;
&#91; reading off what he &apos;s writing : &#93; Finn and Jake .
&#91; The contract is lit on fire and disappears .
The Scorcher emits a black vapor and vanishes , taking the vapor with him .
Ice King starts laughing .
He flies over to his telescope . &#93;
Whoosh !
&#91; He looks at Finn and Jake &apos;s house .
He sees Finn and Jake inside .
He also sees the Scorcher outside , looking at them . &#93;
A-ha , there he is .
Huh ?
What &apos;s he doing ?
&#91; The Scorcher lights their Tree Fort on fire .
The Scorcher then disappears while a fire rages . &#93;
What the — ? !
I hired a hitman , not a fireman !
&#91; Ice King flies out of his castle . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to inside of the Tree Fort .
We can see fires raging outside while Finn and Jake are making sandwiches . &#93;
Jake : Dude , you see my masterpiece coming together , right ?
&#91; Jake &apos;s sandwich is almost as big as Jake &apos;s face . &#93;
Finn : Mine &apos;s whack .
&#91; Finn &apos;s sandwich has two pieces of lettuce , a tomato , and a slice of cheese . &#93;
Jake : Well , put some meat in there !
Finn : Huh .
What kind of meat is that ?
Jake : That &apos;s Meat Man &apos;s meat .
Finn : Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat ?
Jake : I don &apos;t know .
I can &apos;t read his mind .
&#91; Jake is about to take a bite of his sandwich , when Ice King breaks through their wall , spitting ice everywhere , freezing Finn and Jake &apos;s tree house .
Jake &apos;s sandwich gets frozen in a block of ice . &#93;
Jake : &#91; yells : &#93; No !
Ice King : You guys , I — Finn : What do you think &quot; grounded &quot; means ? !
Jake : It &apos;s wasted , man .
Finn : Oh , great .
Now see what you did to my buddy ?
So help me , Ice King .
Ice King : Okay , okay .
Goll .
&#91; Ice King leaves &#93; Finn : It &apos;s alright , buddy .
We can make another .
&#91; Finn puts him arm around Jake to comfort him . &#93;
&#91; Scene switches to Ice King flying to his castle . &#93;
Ice King : Sheesh , this Scorcher guy &apos;s got some weird ideas about hitting .
&#91; Ice King arrives at his house .
The Scorcher hands him a piece of paper . &#93;
Ice King : Hey , there you are !
What &apos;s that ?
I already signed that .
&#91; Ice King slaps the paper away . &#93;
I thought I told you to hit them , not burn them alive !
You big dummy !
Goll !
It &apos;s almost like you want to kill them !
Lucky for them , I stopped the fire !
&#91; The Scorcher &apos;s eyes glow brighter .
He runs out while Ice King rambles on . &#93;
You know what happens when you &apos;re burned alive ? !
Your eyeballs explode !
Bleh !
&#91; Ice King turns around and doesn &apos;t see the Scorcher . &#93;
Hey wha — ?
&#91; Scene changes back to the Tree Fort .
Finn and Jake are asleep .
Finn : &#91; while dreaming : &#93; Punch , punch , punch !
Jake : &#91; while dreaming : &#93; Rainicorn , don &apos;t eat &apos; im .
&#91; Jake snores loudly . &#93;
&#91; Suddenly , the Scorcher appears in the middle of the room .
He turns into a black vapor and covers everything in the room .
He goes inside Finn &apos;s and Jake &apos;s bodies through their open mouths .
&#91; Scene shows Ice King looking through the window .
He gasps and breaks the window open .
He blows winds through the room . &#93;
Ice King : Ice wind !
Blow !
Blow !
Blow !
Jake : &#91; while dreaming : &#93; Meat Man .
Meat Man , I &apos;m sorry , Meat Man , I didn &apos;t mean it , man .
&#91; Jake snores . &#93;
Ice King : Finn and Jake , I am just a dream .
I was never here ... &#91; Ice King flies away . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes back to the Ice King &apos;s castle .
The Scorcher is waiting for the Ice King there . &#93;
Ice King : Okay , mister , you are really trying my patience .
How clear can I be ? !
All I want you to do is hit them .
On the shoulder or something .
&#91; Ice King shows the Scorcher by punching him on the shoulder . &#93;
Are you even listening ?
Oh , I get it .
&#91; Ice King pulls out a wad of dollar bills . &#93;
Here &apos;s double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake .
&#91; The Scorcher burns the money while Ice King laughs nervously . &#93;
You trying to hustle me , Scorcher ?
Okay , I &apos;ll play this game .
How about this prized piece for your pad ?
&#91; Ice King pulls out a deer head mounted to a plaque .
He presses a button , and the deer starts singing &apos; I wanna live live live , I wanna live live live . &apos;
The Scorcher burns it . &#93;
&#91; yells : &#93; No !
Okay , how about these bad boys ?
Night-vision x-ray goggles .
For when you have a lady house-guest .
&#91; The Scorcher burns the goggles off his face . &#93;
Oh , come on !
&#91; Camera shows two Gunters looking at the Ice King , then the other Gunter , then back at the Ice King . &#93;
At least renegotiate the target !
You can destroy my least favorite princesses .
&#91; Ice King holds up a picture of Lumpy Space Princess . &#93;
What about Lumpy Space Princess ?
&#91; The Scorcher burns the picture . &#93;
Ghost Princess ?
&#91; Ice King holds up a picture of Ghost Princess . &#93;
I can &apos;t even hold her with my love mitts .
&#91; The Scorcher burns the picture . &#93;
Aw , geez !
Uh ... &#91; The Scorcher makes a fire in front of Ice King &apos;s face . &#93;
Oh !
A — A leg cramp !
In my leg !
Ow , ow , ow .
&#91; Ice King hops over to a door . &#93;
Oh , this is so embarrassing .
I &apos;ll be right back !
&#91; Ice King exits . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to room near the entry room of Ice King &apos;s castle . &#93;
Ow , ow , ow !
&#91; Ice King hides beside the door . &#93;
Huh .
Think , baby , come on .
Ah !
&#91; Ice King pulls out a laptop computer out of his beard . &#93;
Alright , let &apos;s hit the hitman , right ?
There &apos;s gotta be a — &#91; Ice King searches &apos; Hitman Hitman &apos; . &#93;
Ah !
&#91; A profile for &apos; Blastronaut &apos; comes up .
It reads : BLASTRONAUT - # 1 SOLUTION FOR ALL HITMAN PROBLEMS !
$ 99.95 !
PLACE ORDER &#93; Ice King : Blastronaut .
# 1 solution for all Hitman problems .
Sheesh , 99.95 ?
That &apos;s nuts .
&#91; Ice King clicks the place order button .
A new page pops up that says &apos; ENTER TARGET NAME : &apos; . &#93;
&#91; reading what he &apos;s typing : &#93; Scorcher .
&#91; A new page comes up that says &apos; TARGET ACQURIED &apos; . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes back to main entry room , where Scorcher is reading a book off of Ice King &apos;s coffee table .
A wall suddenly explodes , and Blastronaut bursts in , shooting lasers everywhere .
&#91; Scene switches back to Ice King , who is looking at the Blastronaut . &#93;
Ice King : Sweet !
&#91; The Scorcher is standing still as the Blastronaut &apos;s lasers shoot past him , completely missing him .
The Scorcher walks up to the Blastronaut and slices his suit in half with fire .
A goblin jumps out of the suit .
He runs away , shocking Ice King .
Ice King runs out from his hiding spot . &#93;
Ice King : No !
Come back , you wussy !
&#91; Ice King realizes the Scorcher is watching him . &#93;
Ooh , that was weird .
&#91; The Scorcher turns his hand into a fist and lights it on fire . &#93;
Was that your friend , or something ?
&#91; Ice King laughs nervously .
The Scorcher only gets angrier .
Ice King points above the Scorcher . &#93;
Look , a super model !
Look , a hover-board !
Look , the apocalypse !
Someone got hit in the boing-loins !
Hit in the boing-loins !
&#91; The Scorcher squints . &#93;
Boing-loins !
Boing-loins .
Somebody got hit in them .
&#91; The Scorcher turns around . &#93;
Peace out !
&#91; Ice King freezes The Scorcher and flies away .
The Scorcher is shown melting his icy chamber . &#93;
&#91; Scene changes to Ice King flying away . &#93;
Ice King : Freakin &apos; butt !
Butt , butt , butt !
&#91; Scene changes to Tree Fort .
Jake is looking out of a window . &#93;
Jake : Hey , Finn , you awake yet ?
Finn : &#91; while lying down : &#93; I &apos;m trying .
Jake : I had a dream about Meat Man .
Finn : Oh , yeah ?
Jake : I think I &apos;m gonna stop eating Meat Man .
&#91; Jake turns around just as Ice King tackles him inside .
Finn points to him . &#93;
Finn : You &apos;re grounded !
Ice King : I know , but shush !
&#91; Finn stares in silence as Jake slurps his coffee . &#93;
Ice King : Okay , I hired a guy to kill you by accident .
Finn and Jake : What ? !
Ice King : I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch .
&#91; Finn and Jake stare at him , wordlessly . &#93;
Well , I froze him in ice , but I think he &apos;s free now &apos; cause he &apos;s made out of fire .
Or he commands fire , maybe ?
Jake : Good job .
Good job , the Ice King .
&#91; The Scorcher breaks into the Tree Fort in a cloud of black vapor . &#93;
Finn : Oh , my life !
&#91; The Scorcher throws a fire ball at Jake , who ducks it .
The fire burns a hole in the wall .
Jake throws his coffee in the Scorcher &apos;s face . &#93;
Jake : C &apos;mon , man , let &apos;s get outta here !
&#91; Scene switches to outside of the Tree Fort .
Jake grows big to run quickly away with Finn on his back , and Ice King flies away .
The Scorcher gets up , turns into a black vapor , and follows them . &#93;
Finn : Jake , do something .
He &apos;s getting close !
&#91; Jake stretches out a foot to hit the Scorcher .
He misses .
The Scorcher squints as he summons a giant fire ball .
Jake , in his haste , trips over a tree stump .
Finn and Jake fall to the ground and look up to see the fire ball hurtling towards them .
They hug each other and don &apos;t look .
Before the fire ball can reach them , Ice King builds a barrier out of ice to protect himself and them . &#93;
Ice King : You alive ?
Jake : Uh , I think so .
Ice King : Whew !
That was close .
&#91; Suddenly , the ice barrier starts shaking .
The Scorcher is shown throwing fire balls at the barrier .
Water drips on Jake &apos;s head . &#93;
Jake : Uh , hey , guys ?
I don &apos;t think this ice dome is gonna last long .
Finn : What do we do ?
Ice King : &#91; Ice King closes his eyes in concentration .
He gets an idea . &#93;
Ooh , got it !
I &apos;m gonna kill you guys !
Jake : Hey , I &apos;ll kill you !
Ice King : No , wait a minute , you two .
I won &apos;t actually kill you .
I &apos;m just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead .
And after we fool that fool outside , I &apos;ll warm you up , good as new .
Jake : No way , man !
&#91; Jake turns his back to the Ice King . &#93;
You already messed up enough stuff .
You &apos;re probably gonna kill us , too .
Finn : Yeah , we don &apos;t trust you !
&#91; Ice King zaps them anyway , encapsulating them in ice chunks . &#93;
Ice King : You &apos;ll thank me later .
&#91; Scene switches to outside .
Ice King breaks open the dome . &#93;
Ice King : &#91; to the Scorcher : &#93; Stop !
Time out !
You don &apos;t need to do this anymore !
Look !
They &apos;re dead !
I killed them myself !
&#91; Ice King starts hitting Finn &apos;s ice chunk . &#93;
Dead , dead , dead , dead , dead , dead !
They &apos;re dead .
No pulses .
&#91; The Scorcher squints .
He melts Finn &apos;s ice chunk to feel his pulse on his arm .
The Scorcher nods . &#93;
Ice King : So , uh , looks like , you can go home now .
&#91; The Scorcher produces a contract from a fire .
Ice King yells until he realizes what it is . &#93;
Ice King : Oh , yes , of course .
&#91; He signs the contract . &#93;
There .
&#91; The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor .
He leaves a paper that reads : Echos of past events nudge the tiller on my present course I await its reflection in the future .
Ice King looks at it and throws it away . &#93;
Ice King : Oh , glad all that &apos;s over .
&#91; Ice King gets up on Finn and Jake &apos;s ice chambers . &#93;
Hey , guys , guess what ?
You &apos;re grounded .
Underneath my butt !
&#91; Ice King laughs . &#93;
&#91; Flame Princess slaps Finn , leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face . &#93;
Flame Princess : Don &apos;t ever mess with me again !
&#91; Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Looks at Jake &#93; Who was that ?
Jake : &#91; Still terrified &#93; The Princess of the Fire Kingdom ?
Finn : &#91; Looks out the window , then back at Jake &#93; Dude , I think I have a crush .
&#91; Finn walks in front of Jake . &#93;
Finn : What do you know about her , Jake ?
Jake : I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up .
But she &apos;s evil , man !
Finn : You shut your dirty mouth !
&#91; Slaps Jake .
Finn &apos;s angry outburst causes the burn mark to disappear &#93; Jake : Dirty ?
&#91; Checks gums &#93; Oh .
No , really man !
Her dad said she was evil !
Finn : Naw , man , I peeped beyond her burning gaze , and noshed hot lunch with her soul .
&#91; Walks to the window &#93; She ain &apos;t evil .
She &apos;s passionate .
Help me track her down .
Jake : Hmmm .. Finn : C &apos;mon , man , I really like her .
Help me out .
&#91; Rubs Jake &apos;s face &#93; Jake , Jake help me out .
Help me out .
Jake , Jake , help me .
Jake , Jake , help me !
Jake : Eeeeeeeeehhh , ok . Finn : Whoo !
Alright !
&#91; The scene cut to Jake walking over trees as a giant with Finn on his head . &#93;
Jake : You sure you &apos;re not into any other princesses ?
What about Wildberry Princess ?
She &apos;s small and plump .
You could sleep on her like a pillow .
Could be nice .
&#91; Light shines on Finn and Jake as a burning bird flies away . &#93;
Finn : Is that bird ... smoking ?
Brown Bird : Hey , don &apos;t you judge me .
It was that fire chick down there that done this to me .
&#91; Jake stretches down the bushes as he and Finn hide behind them .
They see Flame Princess touching flowers and burning them &#93; Flame Princess : Oh .
&#91; The fire burns other flowers , spreading towards a lake . &#93;
Flame Princess : &#91; Gasps &#93; Finn : Oh , Jake ... look at her .
She &apos;s innocent .
Like the steam off a puppy &apos;s nose , searching for ham in the snow .
Jake : Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it !
Snap out of it !
She &apos;s burning cute little flowers !
Finn : &#91; Focusing on Flame Princess &#93; Yeah , she is like a cute little flower .
&#91; Flame Princess walks towards the lake , kneels and dips her hand in it &#93; Flame Princess : Aaahh !
Finn : &#91; Comes out of the bush &#93; Oh , no , are you ok ?
Flame Princess : &#91; Gasps &#93; Finn : I ...
I was just worried about you .
Flame Princess : Huh ?
Finn : Look , I &apos;m sorry about what I said before .
I don &apos;t know what happened , but I just , I had to see you again .
And , I don &apos;t know ..
I don &apos;t know anything about you , &#91; Flame Princess glows brighter &#93; but I just , I really like you .
You know , you &apos;re so ... beautiful .
&#91; Flame Princess glows brightly &#93; Finn : &#91; Sees fire beneath him &#93; Whoa !
&#91; Finn stomps on fire , but stops when he sees Flame Princess reacting with pain . &#93;
Flame Princess : Ah !
&#91; Finn stomps on fire again &#93; Flame Princess : Ow !
Finn : Oh , Glob .
Am I hurting you ?
Flame Princess : Yes !
That &apos;s all you &apos;ve done !
&#91; gasps &#93; Are you trying to hurt me ? !
Is that why you &apos;re following me ? !
Finn : I &apos;m not followi-- Well , I guess technically I am following you .
Flame Princess : &#91; Gasps then runs away &#93; Finn : Hey , no wait !
&#91; Chases Flame Princess &#93; Finn : &#91; Laughs awkwardly &#93; I guess now I &apos;m technically chasing you .
&#91; Laughs again &#93; &#91; Jake comes out of the bushes &#93; Jake : Finn !
&#91; Flame Princess burns tree .
Tree falls down , blocking Finn and Jake &#93; Jake : Hold on !
&#91; Turns into a giant and uses his &quot; buns &quot; to put out the fire on the tree &#93; Jake : Eaoww .. Toasty buns .
&#91; Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest &#93; Finn : Where are you ?
I want to chat it up with you !
Oh , we lost her !
&#91; Flame Princess appears as trails of fire then reforms &#93; Finn : Whoa .
Flame Princess : I am ambushing you !
&#91; Throws fireball &#93; Finn and Jake : Aah !
&#91; Finn and Jake run around to avoid fireballs &#93; Finn : Hey , I like your fireballs .
Flame Princess : Huh ?
Why do you torment me ?
Finn : I &apos;m not trying to .
I just like you .
I think I ...
I think I like-like you .
Listen , when I look at you , my brain goes all stupid .
And I just wanna hug you , and sit on the couch and play BMO with you .
I can &apos;t explain why , but , I never felt this way before and I think we should be together .
Flame Princess : I ... &#91; Smiles , blushes and glows brightly &#93; Finn : &#91; Smiles , claps , and laughs in excitement &#93; Yeah .
Flame Princess : Rggh !
Enough .
You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental .
Finn : Wait wait , I really didn &apos;t-- Flame Princess : You told me you liked me , and you made my flame grow brighter , but then you put me out , which hurt !
&#91; Throws a big fireball at Finn and Jake &#93; Flame Princess : You &apos;re trying to impede me .
That must be your purpose , ... but fire &apos;s purpose is to burn , so I &apos;m going to turn this land into my fire kingdom !
Finn : No !
&#91; Flame Princess creates a fire wall as Finn and Jake back away from the fire &#93; Jake : She &apos;s headed for Goblin Kingdom !
We need to defeat this fiery she-beast !
Finn : I can &apos;t fight her , man .
I &apos;m still into her !
Jake : Finn , what &apos;s more important ?
Your love for that screwball dame , or being a hero and savin &apos; the lives of innocent goblin folks ?
Finn : Rrrrhh ..
Being a hero .
Jake : Alright , c &apos;mon !
Let &apos;s go build fire-proof suits .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Tree Fort &apos;s garage . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Frantically searching pile of junk &#93; Uh-uh-uh , I gotta &apos; get back to her .
Jake : Dude , slow down or your fire suit will be junk .
&#91; Sees a bag of bread &#93; Ooh .
Is bags of old bread fire-proof ?
&#91; Slightly shoves the bag , showing Neptr . &#93;
Neptr : Jake , you &apos;ve found Neptr !
I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion !
15 months , 4 days , 9 hours and you guys did not find me !
&#91; Spins his oven body &#93; Hahahaha-hahaha .
Jake : &#91; Whispers to Finn &#93; Oh , plops , we forgot about the game .
Finn : Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh ... Neptr : I missed you , creator .
Finn : And we missed you , too , but Neptr , right now we need you to-- Neptr : To count to 100 while you hide ?
1 , 2 , .. 3 , 4 , 5-- &#91; Finn halts Neptr &#93; Finn : Neptr , will you help us build fire-proof suits ?
&#91; Neptr raises his arm &#93; Neptr : You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up .
&#91; Neptr raps &quot; Working for the Master &quot; as he builds Finn and Jake fire-proof suits while the two assist him &#93; Neptr : I am finished !
&#91; The scene cuts to Finn flying with his suit . &#93;
Finn : I sure hope Flame Princess is okay .
Neptr : Haha , we are as one , creator .
Finn : Jake , you think Flame Princess is okay ?
&#91; Jake rises up as Finn spins to avoid Jake &#93; Jake : DUUUUDE !
I feel like I can touch the heavens !
&#91; Whispers &#93; And sock angels !
Finn : We &apos;re coming up on the Goblin Kingdom .
&#91; Finn and Jake fly above trails of fire as they see the kingdom &#93; Finn : There she is .
&#91; Flame Princess shoots fire on houses &#93; Finn : She seems okay .
Goblin : AAAAHH !
Wood for sale !
Wood on fire for sale !
&#91; Flame Princess shoots out two lines of fire and turns around &#93; Flame Princess : It &apos;s really starting to come together .
Needs more ... fire ... hmm .
Finn : Flame Princess !
&#91; Flame Princess turns &#93; Finn : Listen , you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom , ... but I don &apos;t wanna fight you or hurt you , I swear .
Flame Princess : I &apos;ve heard this all before .
&#91; Shoots fireballs at Finn and Jake but their suits put out the fireballs .
They land in front of Flame Princess &#93; Flame Princess : You ... MEANIE !
&#91; Throws fireball at Finn .
The suit deflects the fireball as the latter bounces .
Hitting a goblin &apos;s cart . &#93;
Goblin : My cart .
I was born in that cart !
Jake : &#91; Gasp &#93; I &apos;ll put it out !
&#91; Jake runs through cart and crashes into a building . &#93;
Flame Princess : Ah !
Finn : Aah !
Jake didn &apos;t mean that !
&#91; Flame Princess shoots a stream of fire at a building . &#93;
Jake : Oh ... &#91; Hovers near the fire . &#93;
I need your help Finn !
This one &apos;s too big !
&#91; Kicks fire &#93; Flame Princess : Ah !
Whyyyy ? !
Finn : No , Jake , stop .
You &apos;re hurting her !
Neptr : I will solve this , creator .
I will extinguish her using our suit !
Foam blaster .
&#91; Neptr raises the suits right arm and retracts the hand into a blaster . &#93;
Hold still , burning lady .
&#91; Neptr turns the suit around and aims the blaster at Flame Princess &#93; Finn : Wha ?
Neptr : Locked on target .
Finn : &#91; Finn holds the blaster with his suit &apos;s left hand &#93; No , Neptr !
Neptr : Yes , creator .
&#91; Finn turns the suit around , before the blaster fires &#93; Finn : NOOOO !
&#91; The blaster hits Flame Princess &apos;s fire &#93; Flame Princess : AH !
Finn : &#91; Distressed &#93; I &apos;m sorry !
&#91; Neptr lowers the right arm down , hitting Jake with foam as his suit is covered by it . &#93;
Flame Princess : That is the last time you hurt me .
&#91; Transforms into her giant form &#93; RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH !
Finn : My bad , Jake !
Turn it off , Neptr !
&#91; Finn turns to look at Flame Princess &#93; Finn : &#91; Gasp &#93; Neptr : Oh , my ... &#91; Flame Princess turns around and burns the whole city . &#93;
Finn : NO !
Flame Princess : RAAAAAAAAAHH !
&#91; A &quot; tear &quot; comes out from Flame Princess &apos;s right eye . &#93;
Finn : No more ... No more !
&#91; Kneels the suit then rips out of his suit and climbs at its top . &#93;
FLAME PRINCESS !
&#91; Flame Princess walks away &#93; Finn : I can &apos;t fight her , ... but I can &apos;t let her destroy the city ...
I &apos;ve failed everyone .
&#91; Neptr turns &#93; Neptr : Not true , creator .
You haven &apos;t failed Neptr .
Even if everyone burns , you &apos;ll still have me , creator .
&#91; Finn looks at Jake , who is moving his own suit &apos;s limbs .
Jake takes a scoop of the foam and eats it . &#93;
Jake : Mmm !
&#91; Smiles and gets another scoop . &#93;
Finn : No .
Why can &apos;t I just like a girl ?
&#91; Finn &apos;s tear drops onto Flame Princess &apos;s fire . &#93;
Flame Princess : Ow !
&#91; Looks angrily at Finn .
She notices he &apos;s crying . &#93;
Huh ?
&#91; Dives as a fire towards Finn while she shrinks her size . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Coughs then faints . &#93;
Flame Princess : &#91; Touches Finn &apos;s tears then jumps back &#93; Oh .
&#91; Flame Princess puts all of her fire out . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Gasps for air then coughs ; he sees Flame Princess by his side . &#93;
Wah !
Did I ... do something ... cool while I was knocked out ?
Flame Princess : I understand now .
You &apos;re a water elemental .
Finn : What ?
Flame Princess : You &apos;re my opposite .
You create water .
Finn : What , cry ?
No , I j-- Flame Princess : Yeah , you cry and cry all the time .
Finn : N-No .
I-I don &apos;t usually do that .
Flame Princess : That &apos;s your power .
Finn : No !
N-N-N-NO-NO-NO !
&#91; waves his hands while blushing . &#93;
Flame Princess : Finn , even if we like each other , we &apos;re going to hurt each other .
Finn : No , we don &apos;t have to .
I can take it ...
I ...
I mean , can &apos;t we try ?
Flame Princess : You would defy nature for me ?
Finn : Uh ... yeah , whatevs .
&#91; Finn and Flame Princess hug , Finn tries to bear the pain but pulls away . &#93;
Finn : Aaah ..
Uh .
Flame Princess : Bye , Finn .
&#91; Departs &#93; Neptr : Goodbye , lady .
Jake : FINN !
&#91; Stretches up . &#93;
Oh my Glob , man .
Everyone &apos;s dead , man !
They &apos;re all burned .
There &apos;s barbecued bods EVERYWHERE !
Finn : WHAAAAT ! ? !
Jake : Hah .
I &apos;m just kidding .
I saved &apos; em .
Everyone &apos;s fine , see ?
&#91; Jake gestures towards the crowd of unharmed goblins &#93; Jake : So .
How &apos;d everything go with Flame Princess ?
Finn : She hugged me ... then left .
Jake : Whoa !
How did it feel ?
Finn : &#91; Turns to the direction Flame Princess took while leaving a trail of fire behind . &#93;
It hurt .
&#91; The episode begins showing a black tree .
It turns to show its face . &#93;
Finn : The Tree of Blight .
&#91; The tree roars in the center of a dark forest ; the camera pans out to show Finn and Jake . &#93;
Finn : Every hundred years , it spews evil spores across the land .
Jake : Then let &apos;s burn its butt down to the root rubbin &apos;s .
&#91; The duo walks forward . &#93;
Finn , I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin &apos; us from the woods .
&#91; The Alpha Hug Wolf suddenly lunges out and Finn and Jake gasp .
She lands next to the duo and punches Finn rather softly . &#93;
Alpha Hug Wolf : Huuugs !
Finn : What the — ? !
Is this an extra butt ? !
&#91; Pushes her away . &#93;
Quick , Jake !
Burn the tree !
&#91; Jake runs off . &#93;
Alpha Hug Wolf : Huuuugs !
&#91; Finn grunts and they begin circling each other &#93; Gonna hug you up , boy !
I &apos;m gonna snuggle you to pieces !
Jake : Dude !
The tree &apos;s about to &apos; splode its evil juice all over !
Finn : No !
&#91; Gasps as the ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf makes a roaring charge at him .
The ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf embraces Finn and howls . &#93;
Jake , hurry !
Jake : Is he crushin &apos; you , man ? !
Finn : &#91; Lowering his voice slightly &#93; No , he &apos;s just ... hugging me gently !
Jake : Oh ... !
&#91; Turns and talks to tree &#93; When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife , tell &apos; im Jake says , &quot; Hello . &quot;
&#91; Jake sets the tree on fire which makes it explode ; a piece of the tree lands on the ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf and she runs off screaming .
Finn is violently coughing . &#93;
Jake : Hey , buddy , you okay ?
Finn : Didn &apos;t even tell me its name ... Jake : Wha .. , ?
Finn : &#91; Noticing the tree is burned down &#93; Oh , sweet !
Ha-ha-ha !
Finn and Jake : &#91; In unison &#93; Hot to the touch !
&#91; Scene cuts to Finn and Jake &apos;s Tree Fort .
Jake is whistling and playing Portender Defender on BMO .
He notices Finn is hugging BMO and stops playing . &#93;
Jake : Hmmmm ... Dude , why &apos;re you so huggy ?
Finn : I just feel affectionate , I guess .
Hugging helps .
Jake : Hmm ... &#91; Feels Finn &apos;s forehead &#93; You &apos;ve got a fever , man .
Finn : I feel hot .
&#91; Holds BMO tighter &#93; BMO : Finn , you &apos;re hurting me .
Jake : I think you need a good night &apos;s sleep .
&#91; Scene transition to Finn and Jake &apos;s bedroom .
Finn is seen hugging a pillow and Jake blows out a candle .
Finn whines like a dog in his sleep .
Cut to the next day ; Finn and Jake are picking up litter in the Candy Kingdom . &#93;
Jake : You feelin &apos; better today ?
Finn : Yeah .
I feel like a million clams .
Jake : Good .
Hey , you think we have enough candy litter ?
&#91; Eats some of it &#93; Litter for lunch !
Mmm !
&#91; Finn continues picking it up and Cinnamon Bun enters and runs into Finn . &#93;
Cinnamon Bun : Huh ?
Not again !
Finn : What &apos;s the matter , Cinnamon Bun ?
Cinnamon Bun : Please , Finn .
If you &apos;re gonna hug me again , don &apos;t make it as hard as you hugged me last night .
Finn : Uh ...
I didn &apos;t hug you last night .
Cinnamon Bun : Yes , you did !
My love handles still hurt !
You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze — a really strong one !
&#91; Groans in pain &#93; &#91; Jake joins in . &#93;
Finn : CB says I hugged &apos; im .
Haha .
Cinnamon Bun , you got some crazy notions .
I tell ya .
&#91; Laughs ; Cinnamon Bun also starts to laugh .
Jake just makes a worried face .
Cinnamon Bun exits as his laugh fades .
Finn and Jake sit down . &#93;
Oh , Cinnamon Bun .
&#91; Eats some candy litter &#93; &#91; Muffled &#93; What a crazy story , buddy .
Jake : Yeah , buddy , but you were pretty huggy last night ... buddy .
Finn : Wait .
You don &apos;t think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun &apos;s room and hugged him , do you ?
Jake : I &apos;m just sayin &apos; you were really clingy .
Finn : &#91; Eats more litter &#93; &#91; Muffled &#93; But no .
Why would I ?
And don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun .
Jake : No .
I have a theory , ... but I don &apos;t like it .
&#91; Scene cuts to a library . &#93;
Jake : Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man , right ?
Finn : ... So ... ?
&#91; Jake pulls out a book and drops it on the ground .
Jake opens it . &#93;
Jake : Well , I &apos;ve been thinkin &apos; that maybe that wolf man wasn &apos;t what he seemed .
Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf .
Yeah , here it is .
&#91; Reading book &#93; &quot; Hug wolves — a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust .
Every night , hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs .
To become a hug wolf , one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon . &quot; !
Finn : Like last night !
Jake : Yes .
So you must be a beta hug wolf .
A lower-level creature .
Finn : Well , how can I get uncursed ?
Jake : Lemme , um ... read the book a little more .
Says there &apos;s no known cure .
Finn : Uh ...
I &apos;m scared , Jake ... &#91; Attempts to hug Jake but he slaps him away &#93; Jake : No hugs ! !
Finn : I &apos;m sorry !
&#91; Grunts &#93; I feel hot !
Rrrrr ! !
&#91; Jake looks worried .
Cut back to the Tree Fort where Jake is covering Finn with bags of frozen peas .
BMO is whimpering . &#93;
Jake : What &apos;s wrong , BMO ?
BMO : I am terrified of Finn .
Jake : Hmm .
Well , that plant &apos;s not gonna protect you .
&#91; BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief &#93; You can get this under control , buddy .
ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING ? ?
Finn : I think so .
Jake : I said ... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING ? ?
Finn : Yeah .
I heard you .
I said I think so .
Jake : I &apos;m tryin &apos;a &apos; getcha to shout .
Finn : Oh .
Okay .
IS THIS GOOD ? ! ?
Jake : Never mind .
Now .
I want you to think about hugging a cactus .
How would that feel ?
Finn : Prickly and painful .
Jake : Good , good , you &apos;re doin &apos; great !
Finn : Cool .
So , can I hug the cactus now ?
Jake : No , you can &apos;t hug anything .
Finn : But that poor cactus !
It ... it ...
NEEDS ME !
&#91; Stands up and knocks bags of peas off body , knocking Jake down .
He pants heavily then growls . &#93;
Jake : Oh , no , the hug lust is already takin &apos; over your brain !
Finn : &#91; Growling fiercely &#93; I want to hug you , Jake !
Close !
&#91; Jake ties Finn up with rope then chains him down . &#93;
Jake : Finn ... say something to reassure me .
Finn : I &apos;LL HUG YOUR MOM !
&#91; Jake makes a frightened noise and backs away quickly . &#93;
BMO : Jake !
We need the silver baseball !
&#91; The full moon outside is shown and shines from behind the clouds .
Finn completes his transformation . &#93;
Finn : Hrrugs ! !
HUGS FOR BUDDIES !
&#91; Howls &#93; BMO : Oh , Glob !
Oh , my Glob , Jake !

Finn : Bring it in , guys !
BMO : Screamoooo !
Jake : BMO !
Strobe light mode !
&#91; BMO activates his strobe lights . &#93;
Finn : Not cool !
Jake : Back , beast !
Finn : Hug wolf , away !
&#91; Finn busts out of a window howling and runs to the Candy Kingdom .
The scene cuts there . &#93;
Mr. Cupcake : Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers .
&#91; Finn pants heavily and his POV is viewed as he watches Mr. Cupcake and goes towards him . &#93;
Hellooo ?
Good heavens !
A lycanthrope !
AAAAH ! !
Finn : &#91; Hugs him &#93; Hug you up , bro !
&#91; Grunts and roars as Mr. Cupcake groans &#93; &#91; Finn jumps to the Gumdrop teenager &apos;s balcony and enters her room and creeps towards her in bed &#93; Gumdrop teenager : Dracula ?
AAAAH ! !
Eeee ! !
Finn : &#91; Roaring &#93; HUUUUGS ! !
&#91; The Gumdrop Dad bursts in holding a Candy cane shotgun . &#93;
Gumdrop dad : Get away from my daughter , ya hairy teenager !
&#91; Mimicking the sound a shotgun makes when one cocks it &#93; Ch-ch ... &#91; Mimics a gunshot noise and shoots the teenager &apos;s mirror . &#93;
Gumdrop teenager : Aaah ! !
Gumdrop dad : Ch-ch .
&#91; Fake gunshot noise ; repeats a couple of times as Finn runs away &#93; Ch-ch .
&#91; Goes towards window &#93; Eh ... eh ... SHE &apos;LL NEVER MARRY !

Jake : Finn ?
Finn ?
BMO : There he is !
&#91; Finn is in a river .
Jake shakes him awake . &#93;
Finn : Huh ?
Huh ?
&#91; Princess Bubblegum chases a cat in the background &#93; What ... What happened ?
Jake ... what happened to me last night ?
Jake : You hugged ... everyone .
Finn : NO !
&#91; Candy People appear and shout angrily &#93; Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone : We &apos;re mad , but we &apos;re not gonna go down there .
Finn : People of the Candy Kingdom , all I &apos;ve ever wanted was to keep you all safe , ... and because I can &apos;t undo the hugs I &apos;ve caused , my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Candy Dungeon . &#93;
Candy Baby : Why &apos;s Finn in the cage , Mama ?

Cinnamon Bun : Uuuuuhhhh ... Jake : Let &apos;s go , boys ! !
Cinnamon Bun : Uh ... bu- , bububut ...

Random Candy Person : Without consent ! !
Cinnamon Bun : Uh ... Finn : Huh ?
&#91; Watches full moon appear from behind clouds and gasps &#93; HUUUGS ! !
&#91; Growls &#93; Cinnamon Bun : Finn ?
&#91; Finn keeps growling as he transforms . &#93;
Uh ... Finn &#91; Fully transformed &#93; : Cinnamon Bun ... let me out ... Cinnamon Bun : I-I-I-I &apos;m not supposed to .
Finn : Don &apos;t you want a hug ?
Cinnamon Bun : I can &apos;t , man !
Finn : Not even a little one ?
Cinnamon Bun : Uuuuhhh ... Finn : You want a hug ?
Cinnamon Bun : &#91; Mutters &#93; YES ! !
HUG ME ! ! ! !
&#91; To himself &#93; C &apos;mon , c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon ... &#91; Unlocking door &#93; Which way does this turn ? ! ?
&#91; Finn lunges out with a roar and tackles Cinnamon Bun . &#93;
Owww !
Ow , my sides .
&#91; Scene cuts to the forest from the beginning of the episode . &#93;
Candy crowd : SAY NO TO HUGS !
Jake : I smell someone bein &apos; hugged right now !
&#91; Spots ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf hugging an antelope . &#93;
Antelope : Uh ...
I have a wife .
Jake : That hug be your last , demon !
&#91; Jake stretches his arms and repeatedly punches the ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf &#93; Alpha Hug Wolf : Rrr ... still love you !
&#91; Attempts to embrace Jake &apos;s arms but misses &#93; Raaah !
Come here , baby !
Jake : No huggies !
&#91; ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf lands in front of Jake and the crowd .
The crowd mutters , frightened . &#93;
Eh ... Finn ...
I &apos;ve failed you .
&#91; Suddenly , Finn lunges out in the same way the Alpha Hug Wolf did at the beginning of the episode and tackles her .
They commence their &quot; hug battle . &quot; &#93;
Alpha Hug Wolf : I &apos;m gonna hug you up .
Finn : You call that a hug ?
&#91; They continue their battle . &#93;
Jake : This is the biggest hug that &apos;s ever existed !
&#91; Finn and the wolf begin sparking as they battle .
The ‎ Alpha Hug Wolf forces Finn near a cliff , but Finn gets a hold of her before she can push him off .
They both start glowing ; they howl as soon an explosion occurs and forms a heart-shaped cloud that blows several mountain goats away .
The smoke clears . &#93;
Finn &#91; Back to normal &#93; : Uuuugghhh ... Huh ?
&#91; Finn notices that the ‎ Beautiful Lady is also back to normal ; she lets out tired groans &#93; You ... You stopped hugging me .
Beautiful Lady : Yeah ... You stopped , too .
Finn : I just ... didn &apos;t feel like I needed any more hugs .
Beautiful Lady : Me neither .
Candy Person # 29 : The curse is broken !
Jake : &#91; Runs up to her &#93; Can I get a hug ?
Finn : &#91; disgusted &#93; JAKE ! ! ! ! !
&#91; Suddenly , the girl turns into another screeching Tree of Blight &#93; Jake : AAAH — !
&#91; The episode begins in the Ice Kingdom . &#93;
Ice King : &#91; Off-screen &#93; Okay , Gunter !
You ready for the show to begin ? !
Gunter : Wenk !
&#91; Sips drink &#93; Ice King : One , two , three ... &#91; He comes out , revealing he &apos;s wearing a Marceline wig . &#93;
&#91; Singing &#93; Gunter !
&#91; Sings the Gunter version of the Fry song &#93; &#91; Gunter stares lovingly at Ice King . &#93;
&#91; Speaking &#93; It &apos;s rhetorical , Gunter .
Marceline &apos;s songs are so good !
Mmm ... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me !
&#91; The penguin pulls off Ice King &apos;s wig . &#93;
Man , if she helped me write a song like that , I &apos;d be crushin &apos; it nonstop with the princesses !
Ooh , yeah !
&#91; The Ice King notices that the penguin is chewing on the wig . &#93;
Heh !
Gunter , you cute little dummy .
You know , Gunter , my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in .
Hmm .
&#91; Walks to a bookshelf and pulls out a book &#93; Ice King : Jay T. Doggzone always says , &quot; Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts . &quot;
And I &apos;ve got a way tortured past !
... I think .
I don &apos;t really ... re ... &#91; Unsure &#93; Hmm .
&#91; Flies up and grabs the penguin &#93; Quickly , Gunter !
To the &quot; The Past &quot; room !
&#91; Carrying the penguin , he flies down to the depths of his lair and arrives in a room full of various items . &#93;
Ah , yes .
&#91; He opens a drawer and takes out his scrapbook . &#93;
Ice King : Lot of emotional , powerful stuff in here .
&#91; Sniffs it &#93; Still wet with tears ...
I &apos;ll take some-a &apos; these for lyrical inspiration .
&#91; Throws scrapbook on pile of junk &#93; So where &apos;s Marceline living these days ?
Penguin : Wenk .
Ice King : A cave ? ?
&#91; Blows a small raspberry &#93; &#91; Ice King flies out of his lair , carrying the penguin , an Omnichord , and a drumset .
He &apos;s being viewed through binoculars . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Viewing Ice King &#93; Well , well , well .
Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits , brotha .
Jake : Bad biscuits make the baker broke , bro .
Finn : Ice King , you make our job too easy .
You ready to roll on this fool ?
Jake : Dinner roll !
&#91; Scene transition to Marceline &apos;s cave .
Marceline is strumming her ax bass .
She notices Ice King coming in the cave through her window . &#93;
Ice King : Hello ?
Anybody home ?
Marceline : &#91; To herself &#93; No ... &#91; She goes outside her house . &#93;
What are you doing here ?
I told you not to come around me !
Ice King : &#91; Laughs &#93; Uh , yeah , I know , but ...
I was hoping you could help me write a song — one that could help me get some princess action .
Marceline : I &apos;m not gonna help you pick up on chicks !
Ice King : &#91; Desperate &#93; Come on !
We could be a prog rock duo !
I &apos;ll even split the fans with you .
I get the princesses , and you get ... whatever it is you &apos;re into .
Sounds good , yeah , I think it does !
&#91; Beat ; Marceline is scowling . &#93;
Ee-yoop !
&#91; He laughs as he flies into her house .
Marceline waves Gunter goodbye and follows Ice King .
Gunter looks down in disappointment and walks away . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Landing on porch ; to Ice King &#93; Hey ! !
Ice King : Eh ... Marceline : Get outta here ! !
Ice King : Wait !
Just let me play you what I &apos;ve written so far !
&#91; He unties his equipment and it falls to the ground . &#93;
&#91; To himself &#93; Oh .
Dang it .
Tangles in the cord .
Sometimes this happens when you fly with it ... Tangles are hard ... &#91; He grunts as he tries to untangle it .
Marceline just stares . &#93;
Oh .
Aw , aw , geez , no ... Oh , no .
&#91; He lays on the ground , trapped in the tangled cord . &#93;
Ice King &apos;s in trouble .
&#91; She looks at him awkwardly . &#93;
&#91; Grunts &#93; &#91; To Marceline &#93; Hey , you know what ?
I &apos;ll just hum it for ya .
&#91; Hums a tune &#93; Is that good ?
&#91; The door opens . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : Ice King !
Finn : ... Wha ?
Jake : Oh ... You got &apos; im .
Finn : Nice job , Marceline .
&#91; Jake walks up to Ice King . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Talking like Batman &#93; Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick .
&#91; Jake picks up Ice King .
He and Finn start to walk off with him . &#93;
Marceline : No , he can stay .
Finn &amp; Jake : Wha ? !
Ice King : Yeah , &quot; Wha ? ! &quot;
Marceline : It &apos;s alright .
We &apos;re working on a song together .
&#91; She takes Ice King . &#93;
Finn : You don &apos;t want us to ... &#91; Connects palm with fist &#93; ... for you ?
Marceline : No , it &apos;s okay .
You guys can go .
&#91; Finn and Jake begin to exit , confused . &#93;
Finn : ... Okay ...
Well ...
I guess we &apos;ll see ya , then ... &#91; They look around awkwardly . &#93;
Finn &amp; Jake : Bye ... &#91; They exit . &#93;
Ice King : &#91; To Marceline &#93; You know , I kinda like bein &apos; tied up in these cords .
Kinda freak-aaaayyy !
&#91; She immediately drops him . &#93;
&#91; Scene transition .
Marceline plugs in and turns on the Omnichord . &#93;
Marceline : So what kinda song &apos;re we playing ?
Ice King : Ooh .
I brought these &#91; the scrapbook pages &#93; for some inspiration .
Just use these to work off of .
Y &apos;know , a template .
&#91; She grabs a page .
It &apos;s drenched in tears . &#93;
Marceline : Oookaaaay ... &#91; She plays the Omnichord . &#93;
Ice King : Yeah .
Yeah , that &apos;s good !
Keep doin &apos; that !
&#91; Ice King snaps to the music . &#93;
&#91; Singing &#93; Slime Princess , you &apos;re alright .
Flame Princess , you &apos;re okay .
Wildberry Princess could be better .
All of the princesses are pretty alright , but ... Oh , Bubblegum !
You look like a lot of fun !
I &apos;m right outside , and that is how I know !
Hey , princess , did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show ?
I &apos;m also workin &apos; on my pecs !
If you like , I &apos;ll send a picture of that , too !
Oh , Bubblegum !
&#91; Marceline looks uncomfortable . &#93;
I really need someone .
&#91; She sadly looks down . &#93;
Or anyone !
&#91; Saddening &#93; ... Pretty much anyone .
I &apos;m so alone !
&#91; Activating ice magic &#93; Won &apos;t somebody tell me what &apos;s wrong with me ? !
&#91; Shooting frozen lightning bolts &#93; Anybody !
&#91; Tearing up &#93; Anybody !
&#91; Marceline turns at the sound of his distress . &#93;
&#91; Speaking &#93; Anybody ! ! !
&#91; Practically sobbing &#93; Grod in the sky , please tell me why ! ! !
Marceline : Stop acting like this ! !
Ice King : No , it &apos;s just startin &apos; to get good ! !
&#91; Shooting ice beams everywhere , singing &#93; Anybody ! !
&#91; Speaking &#93; Princesses , I command you , love me ! !
Love me ! !
Love me ! !
&#91; Crying &#93; Love me ! !
&#91; She forces him to the ground . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Direct &#93; STOP ACTING CRAZY .
Ice King : I JUST WANNA BE LOVED ! !
&#91; Pushes her off forcefully &#93; Uh-oh .
I &apos;m sorry I pushed you .
&#91; He goes to the kitchen and plants his head against the refrigerator in sadness . &#93;
Uh ... oh ...
I &apos;ll just stay out of your way .
&#91; Climbs on refrigerator &#93; Again , I &apos;m sorry I pushed you .
&#91; Marceline walks to the refrigerator and sighs .
She then opens it and takes out an apple .
Ice King &apos;s beard lightly rubs her head . &#93;
Marceline : Huh ?
Ice King : Whatcha got ?
An apple ?
Marceline : &#91; Frustrated &#93; Ugh !
&#91; She drops the apple and just drops down , sitting in front of the fridge .
She rolls the apple away ; the apple reaches the Omnichord and turns it on . &#93;
&#91; Singing &#93; You &apos;re so annoying , you pitiful old man .
I &apos;d like to help you , but I don &apos;t know if I can .
I thought you were nuts , but you &apos;re really really really nuts .
&#91; Beat &#93; Every time I move , eventually , you find me , and start hanging around .
Just another lame excuse to see me .
Man .
It &apos;s getting me down .
You know , I &apos;m actually glad ... to see you !
&#91; Speaking &#93; Maybe I &apos;m the one who &apos;s ... &#91; Sighing &#93; nuts .
&#91; The Omnichord switches off . &#93;
Ice King : Hold on !
&#91; Drops from fridge &#93; Do you ... like me ? !
Marceline : ... Of course I do , you old jerk !
Ice King : Really ?
... Wow .
&#91; Wipes dirt off sleeve &#93; How about ... &#91; Spreading arms out &#93; one of these ?
&#91; Marceline &apos;s scowl fades .
She consents and hugs him , visibly bittersweet about it . &#93;
Ah !
&#91; They pull back and look at each other in the eyes .
He puckers his lips . &#93;
Mwah , mwah , mwah ... Marceline : &#91; Disgusted &#93; AAAAAGH ! ! !
Not like that ! !
You don &apos;t remember anything , do you ... SIMON ?
Ice King : What-mon ?
Marceline : Why do you even come see me when you don &apos;t remember me ? !
You don &apos;t even know who you are !
Ice King : Yes , I do !
I am a lyricist !
&#91; Pulling pages out &#93; It &apos;s all here !
On the page !
The page in song , baby !
On this receipt !
On this takeout menu !
On these newspapers !
&#91; Laughs &#93; &#91; Marceline stares , devastated .
A photo lands in her hands . &#93;
Marceline : Huh ?
Look !
This clipping !
This was you , Simon !
Before the War !
&#91; The picture portrays a human Ice King walking out of a car ready to deliver the Enchiridion to a museum . &#93;
Ice King : Huh ?
&#91; He can &apos;t make heads or tails of it . &#93;
Heh ?
&#91; Marceline hurries to look for something else .
She finds a picture of herself as a child and gasps . &#93;
Marceline : This !
You took this picture !
Grr , you &apos;ve scribbled all over it ... Huh ?
&#91; She reads the back of the photo , visibly in great shock . &#93;
Ice King : Ooh , ooh , are they good lyrics ?
&#91; Grabbing Omnichord &#93; I &apos;ll get the keyboard !
Marceline : What ?
&#91; In desperation &#93; Wait , listen !
Ice King : &#91; Sets Omnichord up &#93; Yeah , let &apos;s go !
What &apos;s it say ?
Sing out , sister !
&#91; Marceline reads the message again , then stares at Ice King , not sure what to do . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Singing and reading note &#93; &quot; Marceline , is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world ?
That must be so confusing for a little girl .
And I know you &apos;re going to need me here with you ... but I &apos;m losing myself , and I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to lose me , too ... &quot; Ice King : Ooh , yeah !
Keep it going !
&#91; Goes to drumset &#93; Marceline : &#91; Looking for another photo &#93; Oh !
Um ... &#91; Singing and reading note &#93; &quot; This magic keeps me alive , but it &apos;s making me &#91; Pulling hair back , stressed out &#93; crazy , and I need to save you , but who &apos;s going to save me ?
Please forgive me for whatever I do &#91; Marceline shrinks in devastation &#93; ... when I don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
Ice King : &#91; Happy &#93; Wow !
I wrote that ? !
Hot stuff !
Marceline : What ? !
You don &apos;t remember what it means ? !
&#91; She grabs another photo and shows it to him .
She tears up as her voice breaks . &#93;
Look !
Ice King : &#91; Reads note while singing &#93; &quot; Marceline , I can feel myself slipping away .
I can &apos;t remember what it made me say ... but I remember that I saw you frown .
I swear , it wasn &apos;t me .
It was the crown .
&#91; He frowns and looks confused , but then ignores it . &#93;
This magic keeps me — &quot; Ice King &amp; Marceline : &#91; Singing together &#93; &quot; — alive , but it &apos;s making me crazy , &#91; Marceline begins shedding tears . &#93;
and I want to save you , but who &apos;s going to save me ? !
Please forgive me for ... &quot; &#91; Finn and Jake are still in the cave .
Finn is looking in the house with his binoculars . &#93;
Jake : What is goin &apos; on in there ? !
Finn : &#91; Takes binoculars off &#93; ... I have no idea .
Ice King &amp; Marceline : &#91; Singing together &#93; &quot; ... Please forgive me for whatever I do ... when I don &apos;t remember you . &quot;
&#91; As the music continues &#91; and Ice King and Marceline sing , &quot; Da da ... da da ... da da ... &quot; &#93; , the scene flashes back to just after the apocalypse .
It looks dismal and there are ruined buildings everywhere .
A child Marceline cries .
Simon Petrikov returns to her and wipes her tears in recompense for leaving her alone .
He walks to a ruined store and grabs a teddy bear .
He goes back and gives the toy to Marceline to make further amends , and she smiles sweetly .
The episode ends . &#93;
&#91; The episode starts when Finn and Jake were helping Flame Princess &apos;s target practice . &#93;
Jake : Ready ?
Flame Princess : Yes Jake : &#91; Sounds of concentration &#93; &#91; Then farts &#93; &#91; Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon . &#93;
Flame Princess : &#91; Shoots the balloon with her fire &#93; &#91; Balloon explodes &#93; Finn : That was awesome !
Alright , alright , my turn .
&#91; Lies on Jake &apos;s back &#93; &#91; Sounds of concentration &#93; &#91; Then burps &#93; &#91; Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon . &#93;
Flame Princess : &#91; Focuses on balloon and shoots the balloon &#93; &#91; Balloon explodes &#93; Finn : &#91; Laughter &#93; Flame Princess : &#91; Laughter &#93; You guys are full of magic air .
Jake : &#91; Gasps &#93; &#91; Farts &#93; Finn : &#91; Disgusted &#93; Gross !
&#91; Rolls with Jake &#93; &#91; Then slaps Jake &#93; No !
&#91; Turns to Flame Princess &#93; Princess ?
You , okay ?
Flame Princess : &#91; Looks downed &#93; Yeah ...
It &apos;s just the air smells bad from your magic tricks , and now I feel sad .
&#91; Looks at Finn and Jake &#93; I left all my scented candles at the castle .
They &apos;d really cut through the magic stink .
Jake : Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get &apos; em .
Problem solved .
Flame Princess : &#91; Sighs &#93; &#91; Then stands up &#93; Then I &apos;ll have to see my dad .
I &apos;m still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern .
So UNFAIR !
&#91; Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form . &#93;
&#91; Screams with anger &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Frightened &#93; Finn : Uh , we can go get &apos; em .
Flame Princess : &#91; Returns to her normal form . &#93;
&#91; Pleasant voice &#93; Really ?
That would be really nice .
&#91; Warns &#93; But don &apos;t let my Pops see you .
I don &apos;t want &quot; His Majesty &quot; thinking I need anything from him .
Flambo : &#91; Farts &#93; Finn , Flame Princess , &amp; Jake : &#91; Surprised &#93; Jake : That ain &apos;t me .
Finn , Flame Princess , &amp; Jake : &#91; Looks at the rock &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : Whoa !
Flambo : &#91; inside the rock &#93; &#91; Farts more &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Approaches the rock &#93; Finn : &#91; Opens the rock &#93; Flambo : Oh !
&#91; Farts again &#93; Finn : &#91; Relieved &#93; Jake : Flambo !
&#91; Whispers to Finn &#93; For a second , I thought the princess was farting .
Finn : Flambo , we need you to cast Flame Shield on us .
Flambo : &#91; Agrees to Finn &#93; Alright !
&#91; Rubs both of his hands &#93; &#91; Flambo casting the Flame Shield ; chants and also creates a series of runic symbols .
He grows two big fists and hits Finn and Jake on the forehead . &#93;
&#91; Scene cuts to the Fire Kingdom &#93; Jake : &#91; Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back , sneaking pass the Flame Guards . &#93;
&#91; Seconds later , inside Flame Princess &apos;s room in the palace &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles . &#93;
Finn : These candles , must be &quot; They . &quot;
Jake : &#91; Sniffing the candles &#93; &#91; Whispers &#93; They smell like an old lady &apos;s bathroom .
Finn : &#91; Whispers with anger &#93; Hey !
Don &apos;t disrespect my lady !
Jake : &#91; Whispers in reply &#93; I said that as a compliment .
Like , it reminds me of grandma .
I love my grandma .
Finn : &#91; Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack . &#93;
&#91; Seconds later , two voices are heard behind the door . &#93;
Furnius : No one comes-sss here .
Not since Flame Princess &#91; Finn jumps and lies close to the bottom of the door . &#93;
leaved &#91; for left &#93; the castle .
Now guesssss what we &apos;re gonna kill Flame King with ?
Finn : &#91; Gasps &#93; &#91; Then whispers &#93; A conspirator with a hiss voice !
Torcho : How about , water ?
Furnius : Even worsssse , we &apos;ll use icccce .
Finn : &#91; Whispers &#93; And a conspirator with an untied shoe .

Furnius : Cuz it &apos;sss more painful , You sssimpleton !
Cold as iccce fallzz .
A perfect death for the Flame King .
Furnius &amp; Torcho : &#91; Evil laughter &#93; Finn : &#91; Gasps , turns around , and Jake is thrown away . &#93;
Jake : Whoa !
Finn : Did you hear that ?
Jake : &#91; Sniffs &#93; Finn : Jake , come on !
We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess &apos;s dad !
Jake : &#91; Drops the candle &#93; Right , right .
&#91; Moments later , outside the room &#93; Jake : &#91; Opens the door &#93; Finn : Dirt bags !
Where &apos;d they go ?
Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Tip toe walking &#93; Jake : &#91; Gasps &#93; &#91; Lesser Flame Guards approaching nearby &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Plans via body language &#93; &#91; Then disguises themselves as a painting &#93; Lesser Flame Guards : &#91; Walking backwards &#93; Lesser Flame Guard 1 : &#91; Notices &#93; Hey , is that new ?

Lesser Flame Guards : &#91; Looks at the painting &#93; Finn : &#91; Concentrating &#93; Lesser Flame Guards : &#91; Moves to the right and left while looking at them . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Still concentrating &#93; Lesser Flame Guard 1 : Hmmm Lesser Flame Guard 2 : &#91; Sighs &#93; Lesser Flame Guards : &#91; Moves to the right &#93; &#91; Gets bored &#93; Lesser Flame Guard 3 : Come on , let &apos;s get out of here , I don &apos;t wanna miss snack time .

Finn : &#91; Falls down toward Jake &#93; Whooooo !
&#91; Falls flat on his face . &#93;
&#91; Questions with disappointment &#93; Why didn &apos;t you catch me ?
Jake : Whoops .

&#91; Moments later &#93; Jake : &#91; Whispers &#93; Vent ahead .
&#91; And looks outside &#93; Finn : &#91; Whispers &#93; Jake , I wanna see .
&#91; Jake steps aside &#93; Lesser Flame Guard 3 : &#91; Eating cake &#93; &#91; Then measures cake &#93; Thirty-seven ... &#91; Eats another and measures again &#93; Twenty-two Finn : &#91; Whispers &#93; No hissing .

Finn : Then , is Flame Princess : evil or maybe chaotic neutral ?
Flame King : She &apos;s evil .
Finn : Okay , so your daughter &apos;s evil .
We &apos;ve established that , but do you think if a good guy really liked her , could he , change her to good ?
Flame King : Hmmmmm , well , there &apos;d be penalties to her experience , if she acted out of alignment .
But , yes , someone could change her .
Finn : &#91; Smiles happily &#93; Finn &amp; Jake : &#91; Leaves the stage &#93; Flame King : &#91; Thinks about his daughter &#93; Change her to good ?
&#91; Worried &#93; &#91; Scene cuts to Flame Princess &apos;s house &#93; &#91; Through window , Finn and Jake look at Flame Princess sleeping . &#93;
Finn : Aww ... Flame Princess : &#91; Breathing &#93; Jake : &#91; Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess &apos;s hair &#93; &#91; Then puts them on her bedside table &#93; &#91; Then suddenly , Flame King appears on the candles . &#93;

Flame Princess : &#91; Wakes up &#93; Aah !
Flame King : Aah !
Flame Princess : &#91; Turns around right after what she saw &#93; &#91; At the top of the Tree Fort , Finn watching , Jake eating a watermelon and Princess Bubblegum showing her latest invention . &#93;
Princess Bubblegum : And so , through my experiments with cloud-seeding , I &apos;ve invented ... liquid pyrotechnics .

Jake : That &apos;s really cool , PB !
Princess Bubblegum : Aw , thanks , puppy .

No .
Come on , Finn , don &apos;t be weird .
Look , I &apos;ll see you guys later .
&#91; The pyrotechnics bring rain clouds and thunder as Princess Bubblegum leaves &#93; &#91; Finn becomes heart-broken as rain begins to fall &#93; Finn : Huh ?
Oh .
&#91; Finn and Jake run inside the Tree Fort away from the rain &#93; &#91; Later , inside the house &#93; Jake : It &apos;s letting up .
Hey , Finn , come on , let &apos;s go do something .
Finn : &#91; Sighing &#93; Jake : &#91; Whispers &#93; BMO , put on a game .

Finn : &#91; Makes a pained noise &#93; Jake : BMO , you look after him with your camera-eyes .
BMO : If anyone tries to hurt Finn , I will kill them .
Jake : Ok , good .
&#91; Jake goes down the ladder , then leaves the Tree Fort . &#93;
&#91; Jake sings the &quot; Lady Song &quot; while walking above the trees . &#93;
Flambo : &#91; Screams &#93; Jake : Woman !
&#91; Flambo is covering under the wash tub and is under attack by Iron Owls . &#93;
Jake : I &apos;ll save you , wash tub princess !
Flambo : &#91; Still screaming &#93; &#91; Jake kicks the Iron Owls and saves Flambo . &#93;
Jake : You &apos;re safe now , Miss ...

Jake &#91; Koala &#93; : Eucalyptus !
Eucalyptus !
Flame King : I don &apos;t like koalas anymore .
Begone !
&#91; Flame King shifts out of his armor as a flame and goes up . &#93;
Jake &#91; Fake Finn &#93; : &#91; Begins to cry &#93; Jake : Dude , don &apos;t cry .
Jake &#91; Fake Finn &#93; : Can &apos;t help it !

Flame King : ... for my evil daughter !
Jake : Whaaaat ? !
Flame King : She &apos;s an unstoppable force of destruction .
Ahhhh , nothing a psycho like you can &apos;t handle .
Congratulations !
&#91; Flame King pulls the lever releasing Flame Princess and his body evaporates and his armor starts to float up returning immediately to his throne . &#93;
&#91; The lamp opens and Flame Princess quickly gets out . &#93;
Flame Princess : I &apos;m so happy !
I &apos;m so happy to meet you , Prince .
You &apos;re my Prince .
&#91; Flame Princess embraces Fake Finn . &#93;

That &apos;s so sweet .
Jake : &#91; Whispers &#93; She seems normal .
Flame People : &#91; Chattering &#93; Yeah , she seems normal .
Flame Princess : Stop whispering !
&#91; Flame Princess transforms to her enraged form and turns the other citizens of the Fire Kingdom into flambits . &#93;
Flambo : Hey , so that &apos;s where I came from .
&#91; Flame Princess returns to her normal humanoid form . &#93;
Jake &#91; Fake Finn &#93; : You know , on second thought , ... we &apos;re not really each other &apos;s types .
Flame Princess : We &apos;re ... what ?
Jake &#91; Fake Finn &#93; : I changed my mind .
I don &apos;t like you .
Flame Princess : You ...
WHAT ? !
&#91; Flame Princess transforms again to her enraged form . &#93;
Jake &#91; Fake Finn &#93; : &#91; Terrified &#93; Uh , nothing .
&#91; Jake uses Fake Finn to pick himself up &#93; Bye , Flambo .
&#91; Runs for his life &#93; &#91; Fire Castle erupts &#93; &#91; Later , Jake runs above ground and is near the Tree Fort . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Panting &#93; &#91; Flame Princess is gaining on Jake &#93; &#91; Jake pushes the door and quickly closes it behind him . &#93;
Jake : Finn !
I really messed up .
&#91; Tree Fort shakes and the fire starts spreading . &#93;
Jake : Finn , buddy , you gotta help me .
I made a mistake .
&#91; Fire closing in and Jake and BMO start running . &#93;
Jake : &#91; Screaming &#93; &#91; The flames start burning the two pictures of Princess Bubblegum . &#93;
Finn : Who lit that fire ? !
I &apos;ll kill you !
&#91; Tree Fort shakes again and Flame Princess appears climbing the Tree Fort outside the window . &#93;
Finn : &#91; Kicks the window , shattering it &#93; Yaaah !
&#91; Finn goes out of the window &#93; &#91; Flame Princess reaches the top of the Tree Fort and Princess Bubblegum &apos;s liquid fireworks are near to her flames . &#93;
Finn : &#91; To himself &#93; Bubblegum &apos;s rockets !
&#91; Yelling at Flame Princess &#93; Don &apos;t you touch her stuff ! ! !
&#91; Flame Princess accidentally ignites the rest of Princess Bubblegum &apos;s liquid fireworks and the drops from the fireworks hit Flame Princess , dousing out her flames . &#93;
Flame Princess : &#91; Screams of pain &#93; &#91; Flame Princess is reduced to her normal humanoid form , which surprises Finn . &#93;
Finn : It &apos;s a girl .
&#91; Flame Princess is still weakening , briefly passes out and begins to fall .
Finn puts Princess Bubblegum &apos;s lock of hair on the side of the Tree Fort near the window he broke and catches Flame Princess in his arms . &#93;
&#91; Finn then goes inside the Tree Fort &#93; Flame Princess : You !
What &apos;s wrong with me , huh ? !
You don &apos;t like me ? !
Finn : &#91; Contrary tone &#93; I like you !
&#91; Flame Princess blushes for a few moments &#93; Flame Princess : What &apos;s wrong with you ? !
&#91; Flame Princess slaps Finn , leaving a hand-shaped burn mark on his face &#93; Flame Princess : Don &apos;t ever mess with me again !
&#91; Flame Princess shoots out the window in a trail of fire &#93; Finn : &#91; Looks at Jake &#93; Who was that ?
Jake : &#91; Still terrified &#93; The Princess of the Fire Kingdom ?
Finn : &#91; Looks out the window , then back at Jake &#93; Dude , I think I have a crush .
&#91; The episode begins in Marceline &apos;s cave just outside of Marceline &apos;s house .
Finn is beat-boxing and Marceline is strumming her ax bass guitar . &#93;
Marceline : Thanks for helping me record , Finn .
Finn : No problem , Marceline .
Marceline : Now , I &apos;m gonna sing something really personal , so don &apos;t laugh at me .
Finn : I would never dream of it ... m &apos;lady .
&#91; Laughs &#93; &#91; Scene shifts to the inside of Marceline &apos;s house . &#93;
Marceline : Now , start a slow beat , and keep it steady , or it &apos;ll mess up everything .
Finn : You got it !
&#91; Finn starts beat-boxing and Marceline begins singing the Fry Song .
Eventually , Finn &apos;s beat-boxing slows down and he sighs . &#93;
Marceline : Huh ?
Finn , you messed the beat up !
Finn : Marceline , if you &apos;re thinkin &apos; about your dad so much , then ... why don &apos;t you go see &apos; im ?
Marceline : &#91; Strums guitar &#93; He &apos;s not worth the effort .
Finn : Not worth what effort ?
Marceline : Well ... first , I &apos;d have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then ... uh ... douse it with bug milk .
Finn : &#91; Finn finishes drawing the face &#93; Oh , yeah ? !
&#91; Goes to grab some bug milk , then returns to throw it on the face ; the bug milk gets absorbed by the face . &#93;
&#91; Note : Marceline is not paying attention to Finn &apos;s actions . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Sighs &#93; And then you &apos;re supposed to chant something like &#91; The happy face glows and the candles next to it light up &#93; , &quot; Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum . &quot;
&#91; Finn laughs and the face changes color . &#93;
But ... I-I don &apos;t really wanna see him .
I &apos;m still mad about the thing with the fries .
&#91; Marceline notices a strange noise and finally looks at Finn . &#93;
Huh ? !
Finn : Wwwwhhhat ? !
&#91; The room changes color drastically ; a portal to the Nightosphere opens where the face was . &#93;
Whoa ...
whoa ! !
Aaagh ! !
&#91; Marceline &apos;s father emerges . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Marceline !
Marceline : Finn ... what the heck did you do ? !
Finn : I ... reunited you with your family ?
&#91; Marceline grunts angrily and Finn backs away . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Is this kid your evil servant ?
Finn : I &apos;m not evil , Marceline &apos;s dad .
I &apos;m super good !
Lord of Evil : &quot; Super good ? &quot;
&#91; Roars &#93; Finn : &#91; Gasps ; Lord of Evil grabs Finn , and begins sucking energy from him . &#93;
What &apos;re you doing ? !
Lord of Evil : Stealing your soul .
&#91; He continues and Finn screams in fright . &#93;
Marceline : Dad !
&#91; Separates the two &#93; Ugh !
You always do stuff like this !
Lord of Evil : Haha !
Oh , Marceline !
I never know what &apos;s gonna set you off !
Whoa !
Is this the family ax ?
Marceline : Wha — ?
HEY ! ! !
Lord of Evil : Did you turn it into some kind of lute ?
Marceline : &#91; Yelling in anger &#93; Give it back , and get out ! ! !
Lord of Evil : Okay , I &apos;ll go .
I &apos;ve got business to attend to , anyway — sucking up all the souls in Oooooo ... Finn : &#91; Stammering &#93; WHA — Gh — NO ! !
Lord of Evil : See you kids later !
&#91; Opens door &#93; &#91; Lord of Evil laughs maniacally as Finn screams , terrified .
Marceline &apos;s father shuts the door . &#93;
Marceline : My bass !
Finn : I &apos;ve unleashed evil onto Ooo !
We &apos;ve gotta stop &apos; im , Marceline !
Marceline : Fine ... but I &apos;m only coming with you to get my bass back .
&#91; Scene shifts to Finn and Marceline flying above a forest . &#93;
Finn : Hey !
How do I kill this guy , anyway ?
Marceline : Finn !
You can &apos;t kill my dad !
Finn : Oh !
I &apos;m sorry !
I didn &apos;t mean — Marceline : No !
You literally can &apos;t kill my dad !
He &apos;s deathless !
Finn : Oh ... &#91; Scene cuts to a field elsewhere ; a bunch of Fluffy People are running around and laughing . &#93;
Fluffy Person : &#91; The Lord of Evil &apos;s shadow falls upon him and he stops running . &#93;
Huh ?
&#91; Camera zooms out to show the Lord of Evil . &#93;
Who the fluff are you ?
Lord of Evil : Um ... Well , I &apos;m sure not the guy who &apos;s gonna suck out your soul .
Fluffy Person : Good &apos; cause that &apos;s , like , my number one fear .
Lord of Evil : Really ! ?
Well ...
I know a little exercise for that !
Wanna try ? ?
Fluffy Person : Wow ... Lord of Evil : First ... close your eyes .
Fluffy Person : Okay !
&#91; Gets pounded by the ax bass . &#93;
AAH !
You coulda killed me !
Lord of Evil : Ah , but I didn &apos;t !
And now , aren &apos;t you thrilled just to be alive ?
Fluffy Person : Yeah , I guess ...
So what ?
Lord of Evil : So ...
This next part will be all the more ... horrifying .
&#91; Laughs maniacally as his transformed face moves towards the screen , sucking the fluffy person &apos;s soul .
Scene goes back to Finn and Marceline . &#93;
Finn : There ! !
Below us !
A gathering of Fluffy People !
May-haps they &apos;ve seen your father !
Marceline ... release the Finn-bomb !
&#91; Marceline drops him and he whistles to mimic a bomb falling ; Marceline catches him before he reaches the ground and he makes an explosion noise .
He notices the Fluffy People shivering . &#93;
They &apos;re all freaked out !
Marceline : It &apos;s because they &apos;re scared of him .
&#91; Camera pans over to the Fluffy Person from earlier .
He is floating and moaning .
Marceline examines him . &#93;
Hm .
My dad &apos;s been here .
Come on .
Let &apos;s go .
Finn : No !
We gotta help this guy .
I &apos;ve got some soul food that Jake packed for me .
You like , uh , collard greens or country-fried steak ?
&#91; Finn tries to feed the Fluffy Person the food but he keeps moaning and doesn &apos;t eat it . &#93;
Marceline : Look .
You wanna help him ?
Help me get my bass back .
Finn : How will that help hi — ?
Marceline : MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR , FINN ! !
And when I get it back ...
I &apos;m gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere !
&#91; Fluffy Person bumps into Finn . &#93;
Finn : Oh , clam !
But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad , little husks .
Right , Marceline ?
Marceline : &#91; Blows tuft of hair away from her face &#93; Uh , sure , yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll do that .
&#91; Scene cuts to the Marauder Village .
The Marauders are sitting at a table talking . &#93;
Head Marauder : So I popped his head like a cork !
And I says , &quot; That &apos;s what I think of Expanding Earth Theory ! &quot;
&#91; They all laugh .
A noise is heard and they stop laughing . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Alright .
Marauders : Huh ? !
Lord of Evil : I &apos;ve got a joke , too .
&#91; It &apos;s revealed that he sucked Marauder # 14 &apos;s soul .
The Lord of Evil pushes him off the chair . &#93;
What wears a dark suit , is completely evil , and is about to suck out all your souls ?
Head Marauder : Yo mama !
Lord of Evil : &#91; Beat &#93; That &apos;s right !
I &apos;m your mama !
&#91; Sucks the marauders &apos; souls &#93; &#91; Scene cuts back to Finn and Marceline . &#93;
Marceline : Red Rock Pass .
If my dad wants to get through the mountains , he &apos;ll have to come through here .
Finn : We can work together !
And smash &apos; im with this rock !
And once he &apos;s smooshed , all the souls will go back to their rightful bods .
&#91; Finn notices the Lord of Evil in the pass singing &quot; Stompin &apos; On Ants . &quot;
The Lord of Evil then sucks the ants &apos; souls .
Finn tries to push the rock , but he notices that Marceline flew down to attack her father by herself instead .
She hisses and charges , but misses her father who ducks . &#93;
Lord of Evil : So , finally taking a run at your old man , huh ?
&#91; Marceline charges , but her father parries the attack and forces her to a wall .
Marceline hisses . &#93;
Marceline : &#91; Losing patience &#93; Daddy ... &#91; Marceline jumps on her father &apos;s shoulders . &#93;
Lord of Evil : &#91; Chuckles &#93; Karate kick ! !
&#91; Kicks Marceline off his shoulders ; she lands on the ground hissing . &#93;
Finn : Marceline ! !
Keep &apos; im right there ! !
HrrrrRAAAAGH ! ! !
&#91; Finn headbutts the rock to make it fall off the cliff and groans in pain .
While fighting , Marceline and her father manage to evade the rock .
Finn adopts a look of desperation .
Marceline struggles to reclaim her bass . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Karate chop ! !
&#91; He chops her ; she hisses . &#93;
You can &apos;t destroy me !
Marceline : &#91; Hisses &#93; &#91; Calming down &#93; No ... D-dad ... I-I don &apos;t wanna destroy you ... &#91; Angered &#93; Look , just ... stay out of my life ! !
&#91; Floats away &#93; Lord of Evil : You &apos;re not even alive !
&#91; Marceline rests next to Finn . &#93;
Finn : You blew it , dude .
We &apos;re supposed to be a team — a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin &apos; -souls ... ball .
Marceline : &#91; Sighs &#93; I just want my dad to care about me .
&#91; Finn frowns ; scene shifts to the Ice Kingdom . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Of all history &apos;s greatest monsters , you are by far the most evil thing I &apos;ve encountered .
Offer your soul to me , dark one .
Gunter : Wenk wenk .
Lord of Evil : NO !
You can &apos;t have my soul !
I don &apos;t even ... !
Look , just get in here .
&#91; He tries to suck its soul , but it slaps him . &#93;
Gunter : Wenk wenk .
Lord of Evil : &#91; Kicks penguin away &#93; Keep your crummy soul !
&#91; Gunter flies through the air , crying , and is caught by the Ice King . &#93;
Ice King : Gunter !
Who told you you could fly ? !
Gunter : &#91; Pointing at Lord of Evil &#93; Wenk .
&#91; Lord of Evil sucks another penguin &apos;s soul . &#93;
Ice King : Huh ?
No one sucks the life from my penguins except me !
... And maybe polar bears , because that &apos;s just nature , Gunter .
&#91; Flies over to Lord of Evil &#93; You darest encroach upon my domain ? !
&#91; Lord of Evil &apos;s face changes . &#93;
You &apos;ve raised my frosty dander !
And for that , I shall — &#91; Lord of Evil shows Ice King his terrifying face . &#93;
AAAAAOOOOOHHH ! !
I &apos;ve soiled my tunic ... completely by choice !
&#91; Flies away &#93; &#91; Lord of Evil sucks all of the penguins &apos; souls and starts growing . &#93;
Lord of Evil : YES ! !
&#91; Marceline and Finn are shown hurrying over . &#93;
Finn : Aw , man !
He &apos;s growing huge !
&#91; Lord of Evil sucks some birds &apos; souls ; he begins sucking souls from all over Ooo . &#93;
Finn : I &apos;m gonna take &apos; im down !
Marceline : Finn , you &apos;re like an ant to him .
Finn : Oh , yeah ?
Well , this ant &apos;s about to get in his pants !
Marceline : &#91; Deadpan , amused &#93; What ?
Finn : &#91; Stammers , embarrassed &#93; You know !
&#91; Picking up Sword of the Dead &#93; Because I &apos;m going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls !
RAAAAAAAAGH ! ! !
&#91; Climbs up Lord of Evil &apos;s body &#93; Give up those souls , Marceline &apos;s dad !
In the name of justice ! !
Lord of Evil : Huh ?
&#91; Not noticing Finn &#93; Oh , Marceline .
Still following me ?
Marceline : I &apos;ll stop following you if you give me back my guitar !
Lord of Evil : &#91; Flicks Finn off with ease &#93; No , Marceline .
Finn : &#91; Flying upwards &#93; NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT ! ! !
&#91; Descends and stabs the Lord of Evil in the head .
Lord of Evil smiles at Finn and reveals his second , monster-like head .
He falls while screaming and grabs hold of a tentacle .
Lord of Evil tries to shake Finn off but he won &apos;t let go .
Finn is grunting and screaming all the while . &#93;
Whoooaa ! !
&#91; Lord of Evil stops shaking . &#93;
The souls ... Lumpy Space Princess !
He got your soul , too ? !
Lumpy Space Princess : What ?
Nah .
I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here , and I wasn &apos;t invited ? !
I was all , &quot; What the lump ? &quot;

Finn : Well , I &apos;ll save you ...
I &apos;LL SAVE ALL OF YOU ! !
&#91; Lord of Evil tries to knock Finn off with his appendage ; Finn evades and struggles until he cuts off the appendage , making himself and the Ax bass fall ; Marceline rushes over and catches the bass , letting Finn hit the ground . &#93;
Marceline : IN YOUR FACE , DAD !
Lord of Evil : Give back that ax , Marceline !
You don &apos;t respect it enough !
Marceline : Well ... you don &apos;t respect anything !
Dad ! !

Finn : BUT — ! !
Lord of Evil : Fine ! !

Finn : NO , WAIT !
Marceline ! !
Keep talking to &apos; im !
When he &apos;s talking , he can &apos;t steal souls ! !
Marceline : I said I &apos;m outta here !
Finn : &#91; To himself and digging around in his backpack &#93; Diversion ... need ... diversion .
&#91; He gasps , pulls out the Walkman and plays the song he and Marceline recorded earlier .
Both Marceline and her father stop dead in their tracks .
Marceline blushes and her father turns around . &#93;
Lumpy Space Princess : Oh , my Glob , you guys !
Drama bomb !
Lord of Evil : Marceline , do you really feel this way ?
Marceline : Dad , I ... &#91; Finn sneaks closer to the Lord of Evil . &#93;
Lord of Evil : Marceline ... of course I love you .
Marceline : Dad ... Lord of Evil : I &apos;m sorry I ate your fries .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
Marceline : It &apos;s okay , Dad .
It &apos;s ... it &apos;s really okay .
Lord of Evil : No , it &apos;s not okay .
They weren &apos;t even very good .
They were really cold .
I love you , Marceline .
Don &apos;t you ever doubt that .
Marceline : I love you , too , Dad .
Lord of Evil : &#91; Tearing up &#93; Oh , Marceline , I am so — Finn : &#91; Flying through the air &#93; YALALALALALALALALALALALALA ! ! ! ! !
&#91; Finn stabs the Lord of Evil &apos;s soul sack with two swords making him scream in pain ; the souls are released .
Finn drops down and repeats the summoning process . &#93;
Finn : MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM ! !
&#91; Lord of Evil is transported back to the Nightosphere . &#93;
&#91; Low , growling voice &#93; I &apos;ll see you in the Nightosphere , ya sick freak .
&#91; Marceline gasps &#93; YES ! ! ! !
Marceline : Finn ! !
How could you do that ? !
Finn : How could I ... save the day ?
Marceline : How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad ? !
Finn : How could I embarrass-save you ? ?
&#91; Marceline attempts to ax Finn . &#93;
WHOA !
Marceline !
Marceline : &#91; Sighs &#93; I &apos;m glad he &apos;s back in the Nightosphere .
That was emotionally exhausting .
Finn : I &apos;m also exhausted emotionally .
Or ... wait .
I mean , I mean physically .
&#91; Finn falls down on the ground , exhausted .
Marceline joins him .
The souls are floating around the sky and Marceline chuckles at them . &#93;
Marceline : I &apos;ve been meaning to ask you ... What &apos;s with that pocket on your shirt ?
Finn : Oh , Jake &apos;s in here .
&apos;Sup , Jake ?
&#91; Jake rolls over , farts and the episode ends . &#93;
